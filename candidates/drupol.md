### Conflict of interest disclosure

- I am an employee of a private consultancy company in Belgium and have been
  working for the public sector at the European Commission as an external
  consultant for over 10 years.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

My journey with Nix began in 2019, and I quickly fell in love with its technical
elegance and the collaborative spirit of its community. However, I have grown
increasingly saddened by the politicization of the project, the erosion of
trust, and the growing division among us. Recent events have exposed a crisis in
our governance, shifting the focus from technical excellence to ideological
battles.

I am running for the Steering Committee to help restore balance, neutrality, and
transparency. My motivation comes from a deep belief in Nix's core values and a
desire to steer the project back to a path where technology and community spirit
are the priority. My family history, rooted in the experience of Italian
immigrants facing discrimination in Belgium, instilled in me a profound
commitment to fairness and inclusivity. I believe the most inclusive community
is one that remains neutral, providing a welcoming space for everyone,
regardless of their background or beliefs, to collaborate on great technology.

I stepped back from maintainership out of principle when I felt I could no
longer support the direction governance was taking. After many conversations at
NixCon and with other community members, I am now stepping forward to help fix
these issues from the inside. I want to help build a resilient, accountable, and
transparent governance structure so we can all work together toward our common
goal: making Nix the best tool for reproducible software.

### What I have done

My contributions to the Nix project are extensive and demonstrate my long-term
commitment:

- **Contribution to Nixpkgs**: I have made significant contributions to the Nix
  ecosystem, with approximately **1,000 merged pull requests**, **4,000
  reviews**.
- **PHP Ecosystem Maintainer**: I was a key contributor to the PHP ecosystem
  within Nix, building tools and improving Composer to enhance reproducibility
  for PHP applications.
- **Academic Work**: In 2024, I graduated with a
  [Master's in CS](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/reproducibility-in-software-engineering-thesis-has-been-published/51181).
  My thesis, "_Reproducibility in Software Engineering_", was inspired by my
  work with Nix and explores the core principles that make this project so
  powerful.
- **Community Engagement**: I am an active participant in the
  [NixOS Discourse forum](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/drupol) and the
  [Brussels Nix User Group](https://www.benix.be/). I also built
  [`markdown-code-runner`](https://github.com/drupol/markdown-code-runner), a
  tool now used in the NixOS documentation.
- **Advocacy**: I have been a vocal advocate for Nix, successfully guiding its
  adoption in several projects at my workplace at the European Commission and
  helping train colleagues.
- **Principled Resignation**: In August 2025, I
  [resigned from my maintainership](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/435310)
  roles in protest of the toxic environment and the lack of transparency and
  accountability in the project's governance and moderation. This difficult
  decision was a matter of principle and directly motivates my desire to improve
  and hopefully fix these issues as an SC member.

### What I will do

My goal as an SC member is to address the governance failures that have led to
division and mistrust. I will work to bring the focus back to technology and
collaboration. My 3 pillars:

**1. Overhaul Governance and Restore Trust**

The recent crises have shown that our governance model is broken. My first
priority is to restore trust through transparency, accountability, and a clear
separation of powers.

- **Mandate Radical Transparency**: I will push for all SC meeting minutes to be
  published within 48 hours. Eventually pushing for live-streamed "Town Hall"
  meetings where the community can directly engage with the SC.
- **End Unilateral Decisions**: I will propose a mandatory "Request for
  Comments" (RFC) process for all significant governance, branding, and policy
  changes. The SC’s role is to implement the community's will, not impose its
  own.
- **Address the Moderation Crisis**: The mass resignation of the moderation team
  was a failure of governance. I will call for an independent investigation into
  the SC's conduct and champion a new, community-developed moderation charter
  that guarantees the team's independence and prevents SC interference.
- **Define the SC's Limits**: The SC must serve the community, not rule it. I
  will work to create a publicly-ratified charter that defines the SC's
  responsibilities and limitations, including a clear "no confidence" mechanism
  for the community to hold members accountable.
- **Resist "State Capture"**: I am strongly opposed to reducing the SC's size to
  5 members. A 7-member committee is more representative and resilient against
  capture by any single faction. I will also formalize team memberships as a
  Conflict of Interest to prevent echo chambers.

**2. Strengthen the Contributor and Ecosystem Experience**

A healthy project requires a thriving and collaborative ecosystem. We must lower
the barrier to entry and establish clear, fair rules for everyone.

- **Champion the Contributor Experience**: As a contributor, I know the friction
  points. I will advocate for a radical improvement of our documentation, a
  structured mentorship program, and better tooling to streamline the
  contribution process.
- **Establish a Code of Conduct for Corporate Participation**: To handle
  conflicts with commercial entities, we need a formal code of conduct that
  applies to all companies. This will ensure a level playing field and provide
  clear rules on honest self-representation and community participation.
- **Clarify Relationships with Forks and Unofficial Spaces**: For forks, I
  support maintaining open communication for critical issues (e.g., security)
  but dedicating our official resources to the upstream Nix project. Unofficial
  communities should be clearly distinguished from official channels and not be
  endorsed or governed by the project.

**3. Uphold Principled Neutrality**

The Nix project should be a neutral ground for technical collaboration. The SC's
role is not to take moral stances on behalf of the community, but to manage
conflicts of interest and enforce rules transparently.

- **Delegate Sponsorship to a Neutral Body**: The SC should not be the arbiter
  of sponsors. I will push to delegate this responsibility to a dedicated
  committee that applies a clear, objective, and community-ratified sponsorship
  policy.
- **Focus on Process, Not Politics**: In situations like the Anduril issue, the
  SC’s job is to ensure immediate transparency and enforce a clear recusal
  policy for the conflicted member, not to litigate the morality of their
  employer. The integrity of our governance process must be the priority.
- **Acknowledge Nuance**: My own views on complex issues have evolved by
  listening to others in the community. There is rarely a simple black-or-white
  answer. The best way to remain inclusive is to focus on our shared passion for
  technology and maintain neutrality on external issues.
