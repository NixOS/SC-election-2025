## Q&A

### Should the SC vote for confidence instead of for no-confidence? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472))


The [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#full-reelections) reads:

> A simple majority within the SC may call a reelection of the entire SC based on perceived loss of confidence.

This can lead to a 3-3 deadlock as we [currently](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) [see](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/6). In this deadlock, neither the reelection, nor any majority vote can pass - the SC is unable to function.

**In many legislatures, this is flipped into a vote of confidence that must pass to avoid a re-election.** This would have the same results for a full SC, but avoid situations like the current 3-3 deadlock.

Do you support amending the constitution accordingly?

### Should Nix transition away from GitHub to a self-hosted git forge? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/326))

### How would you treat SC members with completely opposite political leanings? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/489))


As the title suggests, if some SC members have completely different political affiliations and governance ideas than you, and often disagree with you on decision-making, how would you treat them? How would you ensure that you fulfill your responsibilities?

More seriously, if you find that the faction you represent is not the majority in the SC, what will you do?

- SC members need to work together to come to a consensus, not to push their own ideas as the only right idea - i am very open to discussion, compromise, and even changing my mind
- if i am the minority position then my job is to continue to represent the viewpoint i was elected on, though ultimately find compromise where it is needed

### How transparent should the SC be? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407))


In a [blog post](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html), resigned SC member @Gabriella439 recommended future SCs to increase transparency toward the community. (A different recommendation there, regarding SC size, is the subject of #265.)

In particular, the argument for this went (non-header emphasis mine):

> **Poor self-organization and internal policies/procedures**

[...]

> I think one of the big mistakes we made was that we insisted on **‚Äúspeaking with one voice‚Äù**, meaning that we could not make any meaningful external statements or comments without getting majority approval from the committee (something we had difficulty with on the regular). This is why the committee remained largely silent or slow-to-respond on a large number of issues.

> This problem got bad enough that at some point many members began to break the wall of silence by commenting in an unofficial capacity on high-profile issues so that outsiders would get some visibility into what was going on instead of waiting for us to completely the slow process of gathering enough consensus and votes.

> Another internal policy that I believe was counter-productive was **not disclosing the final votes** on various issues or requiring individual signatories on public statements. Had we done this it would have likely broken a lot of internal stalemates and filibusters if all committee members were held publicly accountable for their policy positions (and therefore subject to public pressure).

> It would have also helped with another issue, which was:

> **Absenteeism**

> For various reasons (some justifiable, some not), at many points in time a large number of committee members would be unreachable, even during crucial junctures like ongoing controversy. This absenteeism was masked by the committee not publicizing that fact earlier. **If we had required all votes to be publicly recorded and all statements to require individual signatories** it would have exposed this absenteeism earlier (and led to quicker corrections).

As such, I would like to ask SC candidates: how do you regard the topic of SC transparency in light of @Gabriella439's recommendations, if not more generally? Further, how would you concretely enact these views in the SC, if elected?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407#issuecomment-3363650972">link</a>)</summary>

i think fairly transparent given the SC is representing their voters

i am in agreement with the other candidates mentioning something along the lines of published minutes, public record of voting, and potentially even an observer if desired... back in the day they used to record the marketing team meetings but that probably isn't too exciting to watch for SC meetings üòÖ

### Are you in any coalitions with other candidates? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/470))

### politics of tech and governing values ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487))


Whereas the existing Nix projects have licenses already, one popular adage states technology is not neutral - perhaps increasingly obviously so, as the impact of technology continues to grow.

As such, zooming out a bit, one of the topics the community has seen different takes on seems whether we should govern by certain values, as exemplified by actions such as the earlier open letter against MIC sponsorships, a sentiment that seemed represented among contributors, or 'keep politics out', a sentiment that has seemed represented more at e.g. the NixOS sub-reddit.

As a candidate, where do you stand on this? What values should we expect you to hold?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487#issuecomment-3393400322">link</a>)</summary>


i believe that there are many contributors who aren't interested in making this project about politics - this probably isn't a controversial stance

i want to put the project first, not politics... but the project is made up of people üòÉ

what i mean by that is there are also many contributors who feel like this project impacts their personal politics and we shouldn't ignore this if it ends up impacting the productivity of the project - Andurial as a nixcon sponsor is a great example of a very disruptive force to the community... a non insignificant number of contributors have made it clear it is such a problem that Andurial sponsors a nixcon so we should respect

</details>

### How do you want to proceed with sponsorship policy? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/342))


Last year, one of the most important questions to people running for SC was sponsorship policy, in particular regarding MIC companies. Since then, there were some efforts on the SC side to draft a comprehensive sponsorship policy, and they also started approving/denying sponsors directly, without delegation to NixCon team.

Do you feel like SC taking on this job is adequate in the long run, or do you see it as a temporary measure? What are your next steps on pursuing a sponsorship policy?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/342#issuecomment-3341537050">link</a>)</summary>

- a large number of community members made their opinions clear that Andurial is not a welcome sponsor, and given the fallout of this i think we should respect those opinions
- at this point there doesn't seem to be much controversy around sponsors anymore, not to a point of causing large disruption so it seems things have improved
- formalizing a policy is important so we don't have bias one way or the other and i would actively pursue a formal policy

### How are you going to interact with Lix? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/283))


Lix is now a major part of the ecosystem, providing a non-commercial, production-ready alternative to Nix. It falls outside of governance power of SC, but coordination with it is of paramount importance for Nix development, security patching, and stability of Nixpkgs (as there have been numerous occasions where Lix has fixed a crucial bug that was preventing Nixpkgs work, while Nix hasn't). Historically, there has been hostility towards Lix and running it on NixOS Community infra.

How do you plan to structure your communication with Lix Project?

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/283#issuecomment-3341561029">link</a>)</summary>

- my understanding is that the lix developers are happy with their current situation and i am very pleased to hear this
- i think they paved the way for future groups to do similar things - not everything needs to be "official"
- as a community we should see what we can do to support lix and help them grow and succeed... their success is our success ‚ù§Ô∏è
- as for hydra and running lix vs nix - i think we should consider this carefully and come up with a policy based on technical merit so no one is caught off guard... let's avoid stirring up controversy for no good reason, a policy can go a long way in this sort of situation
- regardless we need to respect our infra teams and the amazing work they do!

### What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to community and Foundation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337))


(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/34 from 2024 election)

What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to the community? Should they be linked on the homepage? If so, should they be compelled to comply with the Foundation's code of conduct? Should we attempt to convert these communities into official spaces (if so, at what point)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337#issuecomment-3341564252">link</a>)</summary>

- not everything needs to be official
- we should let communities grow organically
- if communities are looking for help from us we can provide assistance and consider marking as official
- promoting nix resources on our official platforms seems like a great way to help grow nix adoption - people can find the space they fit into
</details>

### How are you going to resolve S3 cache situation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/336))


S3 cache size continues to rise. AWS still pays the bills for it, but this part of infra is something that might need a look.

Latest updates on the topic that I could find were from about a year ago on the Discourse:

https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-06-06-re-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-6/46617
https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-07-10-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-7/48821

My understanding is that it's a complicated topic, where a lot of technical decisions need to be made, and Foundation needs to get a lot of talks with various potential partners, and this needs to be coordinated. Binary cache is a center piece of the infra, so its future needs to be well-secured; do you have any concrete steps in mind on how to proceed? Maybe coordinating with someone doing software archiving?

### How are you planning to pursue a trademark? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/340))


A trademark is direly needed, as there are many commercial projects who use "Nix" in their name for marketing purposes, sometimes confusingly. However, the trademark rules have to be reasonable for downstream users, and put clear guidelines. Furthermore, there might be conflicts if the trademark policy doesn't match a company's path. Additionally, it will require a clear set of guidelines between what each of Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS project constitutes, and how much "Nix" they share (possibly with renaming?)

How do you plan to handle this?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/340#issuecomment-3341509626">link</a>)</summary>

- i agree that a trademark is helpful for the community at this point... maybe going so far as to say not having a trademark is potentially harmful to our community
- i would follow up with the foundation board to see where this sits on their priority list and if escalation is possible
- without knowing any additional information at this point i can only say i would actively pursue this and that i would bring transparency to this issue

### How do you want to structure communication with Determinate Systems? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/341))


The title might seem excessively direct. However, last year, there was a question on MIC policy and Anduril ban. Since then, SC has enforced a ban on Anduril job posting. Anduril has been a very controversial company for the wide community; I feel like it's fitting to ask about another controversial company, and how to interact with it.

What are the problems you see with communication between Determinate Systems and NixOS Community? Are there concrete suggestions you have, or would like to propose? What other areas of work (Nix improvements, trademark policy, etc.) do you feel prevent healthy collaboration?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/341#issuecomment-3341545362">link</a>)</summary>

- pursuing trademark seems very useful in this situation
- i would reach out to the nix team and work together with anyone open to it on coming up with a concrete plan to figure out what to do with flakes... at this point we have been in an unfortunate state for years and without a plan could remain here indefinitely
</details>

### How are you going to reform SC? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/284))


To me, SC results were disappointing. Despite the community having clearly cast their votes, not much of substance was achieved in a year. This is indicative of a "committee" situation: where consensus is required to make any decisions. This poses an existential threat to the effectiveness of SC, as SC is meant to represent very diverse parts of the community, that often have conflicting interests. Achieving consensus in such a case is a pipe dream.

That's why SC members need a lot more autonomy, to be able to make decisions on their own (overriden by majority, if significant opposition arises) and not get blocked by achieving impossible consensus. This is the entire purpose of SC, as consensus-driven decisions were made with RFCs, and ran into all the same issues.

Considering this, how would you reform the SC to allow for more individual action and autonomy?

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/284#issuecomment-3341553321">link</a>)</summary>

- the SC is still very new in our community
- it is too soon to conclude the SC is a failure after a single pool of candidates have run, there are growing pains
- let's pay attention to the lessons learned from year one and move forward
- revisit at the end of the next term and decide before the next election if reform is needed

I‚Äôve seen different metaphors for what moderators are supposed to be. Some say moderators are like cops (enforcing rules), others say they‚Äôre like paramedics (helping people in crisis).

But no one has made the case for moderators as _judges_. If moderators are indeed tasked with enforcing rules, who then plays the role of the judiciary in our governance model? Do you think mods alone should be able to decide on the punishment (especially lifetime bans)?

In the current SC, we had three members of the Nix team (Ericson2314, roberth, tomberek) and two members of the commit bit delegation team (jtojnar, winterqt), which arguably reduces diversity as well.

<summary>Stance on specific case of statements made by external actors (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/485">link</a>)</summary>

The following was authored by @jaen but I'm posting it on their behalf because they cannot and I would like answers to it as well. The title of the issue was written by me.

---

The recent SC turmoil had been commented on outside the community in various venues. In particular, I'd like to draw attention to this [Twitter thread](https://xcancel.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1972037286192992320) where certain individuals talk about _‚Äúget[ting] these nut jobs out‚Äù_ and that _‚Äú[M]aybe @<!-- -->PalmerLuckey can help turn the ship around.‚Äù_ While the Anduril founder does not acknowledge those proposals directly, he says this:

> The good news is that Anduril will keep using Nix to build ever more powerful weapons for American dominance regardless of what the fringe "community" people say.

The question is, what is your stance on this thread ‚Äî is it a nothingburger, or an indication of existential threat to community governance and self-sovereignity ‚Äî and what steps, if any, do you plan to take to insulate the project against the threat, should it it materialise into something more concrete than online bickering.

And as a corollary to that, what does Nix governance and self-sovereignity means for you, do you feel it‚Äôs an important aspect for the SC to work towards and what would your be general policy to handle potential threats stemming from external actors looking to control the project to their own ends. Consider what limits ‚Äî if any ‚Äî you would seek to put on such a threat actor, how ‚Äî if at all ‚Äî could that extend to functions community members associated with them could perform at a maintainer and/or governance levels, for example to ensure the threat actor cannot pressure them into acting against the project's best interests.

<summary>What should happen in the event of an SC member resigning early? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481">link</a>)</summary>

The SC is currently elected by proportional representation, which seeks to reflect the preferences of its voters.
However, over this initial SC term we have seen multiple early resignations, potentially making what remains of the SC less representative of its voter base, if not also affecting [decision-making capabilities](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/some-procedural-clarifications-on-the-constitution/70278).

Now, there may be alternate ways to deal with scenarios involving early retirement, including going over the original votes to recalculate what alternate candidate might best represent this part of the electorate, or (eventually) even calling new elections.

<summary>Voter mechanisms to recall individual candidates (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482">link</a>)</summary>

Over the past days, there have been [multiple](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971/) [calls](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/) for individual SC candidates to step down, or even calling for a [full reelection](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/).

Current procedures have yet to take into account such desires, meaning we would currently depend on either:

- SC members voting one another out (re: individual SC members)
- SC votes of no confidence (c.f. #472)

Would you rather see such a formal mechanism to retroactively retract/amend votes or recall individual delegates? If yes, what should this look like? If not, why not?

<summary>Who are "The Nix Community", and why? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/436">link</a>)</summary>

One outcome of the NCA was the "Constitution", which advertises "Values". It falls short, however, of "constituting a community": it does not attempt to describe anything resembling a "membership predicate", a matter that was intensively discussed in the Governance Zulip. I'm interested in the candidates' reasoning and reflection about the community's composition, but here's also a few litmus tests:

- Are DetSys and Anduril "part of the community"?
- Is Jon Ringer "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Is srid "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Generally, how does moderation action affect "community membership"?
- Are former maintainers, who resigned in support of either of the two Open Letters, "part of the community"?
  - If they have not contributed back to the project since?
  - If they participate in discussions on Discourse or in Social Media?
  - If they contribute only to forks?
  - If they contribute to forks, but backport ad hoc?
- Are Lix, Snix, the Foundation, or the nix-community "part of the community"?
- Are NixCon Sponsors "part of the community"?
- Of participants of Nix-Offtopic and Discourse, are those, who do not "contribute" code, documentation, or decision-making, still "part of the community"?

Finally,

- Are people who disagree with the composition or the priorities of the "Values" part of the community?

<summary>How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197">link</a>)</summary>

There is an [ongoing](https://discourse.nixos.org/search?q=Determinate%20Nix%20%23links%20in%3Atitle%20order%3Alatest) conflict between Determinate Systems and parts of the community. Some aspects of this, such as the "Nix the trademark" are likely things for the [foundation](https://github.com/nixos/foundation) to deal with.

However, Determinate Systems is *part of the community* as well, so this conflict also has aspects internal to the Nix community.

How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community?

<summary>How should the SC deal with people in the org chart not respecting their authority? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/491">link</a>)</summary>

This question is based on a question from the previous year: https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114
> **Title: What's the best way for the steering committee to deal with inaction or being ignored?**
> One of the main ways in which the previous Nix governance has been criticized is for ignoring or being inactive in the face of community protests and concerns.[1](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#user-content-fn-1-be51383cd9081764e2d5d66461ad8100)

I would like to specifically add that the party in question might escalate the matter into the court of public opinion.

In the answers from the previous year there was a very clear dividing line among candidates about not only using explicit powers granted by the constitution, versus using activism.

Would you advocate for the SC using activism proactively?
Would you advocate for the SC using activism once a matter is moved into the court of public opinion?
How do you think the SC should react to activism?
At what point should the SC concede to activist pressures?

Adding to that footnote, I also don't mean to say this is hat happened recently or want to litigate specific recent events, I'm interested in other candidates general view on these kinds of issues.

<summary>Should electoral alliances/coalitions count as conflicts of interest? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/479">link</a>)</summary>

Related to #470.

It has been brought to my attention that several candidates are interested in forming electoral coalitions[^1] where candidates agree to vote for each other in time for the election. This could significantly change the result of the election, especially if coalitions decide to formalize which candidates they choose to vote for and which they do not, and if many members of the same coalition are elected to office, their shared interests could dominate the SC. In spite of this, there are currently no rules in place that will require electoral coalition/alliance status to be disclosed in each candidate's statement. 

Do you think participation in coalitions and alliances *has to be* disclosed? If not, do you think they *should* be disclosed?

[^1]: To be clear, *informal* alignments such as friendships do not count here ‚Äî whether *those* should be counted as CoIs deserve a different issue altogether.

<summary>If you were in a previous SC, how would you vote on public issues? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/281">link</a>)</summary>

There were several decisions made by previous SC in response to community conflicts. They set an important benchmark to gauge candidate's decision-making. Those questions are:

    Allow Anduril to keep publishing jobs on Discourse?
    Replace PolyMC with Prism Launcher?
    What should be the policy on MIC participation?
    What should be the policy for telemetry?

What additional initiatives would you raise?

<summary>What are your thoughts on documentation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/339">link</a>)</summary>

Documentation is often cited as being lackluster, incomplete, or confusing. Personally, I disagree; I've seen many improvements to documentation over the years, and I think it has come a long way. Still, those improvements don't address the core issue for why documentation *feels* lackluster.

IMO, the issue is because the boundaries between projects are not clear. A new NixOS user will look at the NixOS manual for help: but really, they are using Nix+Nixpkgs+NixOS stack. For a beginner, it is not clear why there would be three manuals, and where the boundaries lie, and which manual they need (especially when interacting with a layering violation). This provides a frustrating experience, where despite the information being abundant, it is not at all discoverable in a relevant fashion.

Is this something that you are concerned with? What do you want to do with it? Direct more resources into cross-cutting documentation projects, like nix.dev or wiki.nixos.org ? Work on clearer project boundaries? Attempt to bridge documentation?

I am curious to hear your thoughts.

<summary>How are you planning to reconcile conflicts between SC and Nix team? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/285">link</a>)</summary>

Nix is a central piece of the ecosystem, and Nix team holds authority over it. Additionally, many Nix team members are a long-time, trusted community members, making them overwhelmingly more likely to be elected. One of the purposes of SC is to coordinate different teams; this poses a clear conflict of interest, when someone is in both Nix team and SC, as that person's interests as an SC member and Nix team member are not necessarily aligned.

How is such a conflict of interest planned to be addressed, or resolved?

<summary>What is your view on licensing? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/338">link</a>)</summary>

Right now, the ecosystem is very split between permissive licenses (MIT), copyleft-ish licenses (LGLP, MPL), and copyleft licenses (GPL). This signifies a wider disagreement between people on what community is, and what to expect.

Licenses are by no means perfect, but they signify intention and direction. They are like a COC: adopting one doesn't instantly solve all of your problems (nor is expected to), but it shows where the project is heading. This has a lot of consequences later down the line. It could be argued that Nixpkgs being MIT-licensed is a reason why there are so many companies hanging around it; it could likewise be argued that the reason DetSys hasn't been more successful with their "downstream distribution" has to do with LGPL.

What is your view on licensing? Are you planning to put out guidelines for licensing official and community projects? Pursue relicensing various projects?

<summary>What is a "competing implementation", and should being involved in one constitute a conflict of interest? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/456">link</a>)</summary>

(This is a little targeted, though everyone is welcome to chime in with their thoughts, of course.)

In https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3354754312 you said that you're worried about the current definition of "conflict of interest" not including "being involved in competing implementations and communities, social media groups, country, military status, and so forth".

What is a "competing implementation" or "competing community" to you? What level of involvement would you consider significant enough to constitute CoI? What decisions are you expecting the SC to make where this CoI becomes an issue?

Also, once again, as a litmus test, would any of these people be considered to have a CoI?
- a Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc team member
- a Determinate Systems employee
- a Snix/Tvix/Lix/etc contributor
- a contibutor to both NixOS/nix and Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc
- a person present in Tvix/Snix/Lix/etc discussion spaces
- an Auxolotl/Ekala/etc contributor
- a contributor to both NixOS/nixpkgs and Ekala/Auxolotl/etc
- a person present in Auxolotl/Ekala/etc discussion spaces

Also, can you maybe name examples of social media groups or countries that would be considered to have a CoI, and why/when?

<summary>Currently sitting SC members running for reelection: why did you vote the way you did on a vote of no confidence on 2025-09-30? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/452">link</a>)</summary>

Today, [a reply by @jtojnar](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) on the whistleblowing post mentioned that the Steering Committee held a vote of no confidence today, 30 September 2025.

> Vote of no confidence of the entire SC 2025-09-30 (failed 3/6)
> * Ericson2314: -1
> * Gabriella439: +1
> * jtojnar: +1
> * roberth: -1
> * tomberek: -1

A "yes" vote to a vote of no confidence implies that the individual does not have trust in the SC. A "no" vote implies that there is still some trust left.

Why did you vote the way that you did?

<summary>If you are re-elected, how did you vote on previous issues? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/282">link</a>)</summary>

In a similar vein to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/256, opinions on past incidents present an important benchmark to judge candidate's moral and practical compass. This is even more important for existing SC members. SC has some out as a single front to make coordinated statements; I believe that to be an important mistake, that allows SC members to hide behind a bureaucratic body and avoid any kind of accountability. I believe it to be highly unfair. For that reason, I would like to know the historical votes of SC members on various issues.
