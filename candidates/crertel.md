### Conflict of interest disclosure

I own a small LLC--no business for a few years now--that does consulting, and at one point was building a NixOS hosting service. Nothing came of that.

I believe that I have no conflict of interests.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

#### What I have done

I have helped add various improvements ( https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Acrertel ) to the homepage, notably adding the NixOS Values to the website, cleaning up the presentation of official vs. unofficial spaces, updating some links, and so forth.

I'm a maintainer of the lmstudio package (which I'm able to keep up to date with the help of some great folks) and have also adopted some packages that became orphaned for one reason or another (libthai, glee, xscope, bemenu, muso--if you need something there, feel free to ping me!).

I've started a process of adding some missing functionality to the nix-unit package (https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-unit-improvements/69296) in hopes that we can further improve the CI and testing story for NixOS.

I'm a co-organizer of the Nix Vegas community at this year's DEF CON, where we had a great time (https://nix.vegas/blog/2025-retrospective/) talking about NixOS and hosting excellent talks.

#### What I will do

My basic goal is to help make the Nix community and ecosystem boring and predictable, so that everybody--regardless of skill level, corporate or academic affiliation, hobbyist or professional or amateur leanings, or anything else--is able to get value from it and is able to give back however they're able.

There are tactical wins to be had in specific initiatives, for example documentation and on-boarding, and there are also strategic gains to be made in terms of how we work with commercial partners and how we manage our infrastructure. I hope that I can work with other like-minded people on the SC to achieve those goals and to leave the ecosystem better than when I joined it.

I think the SC can do a better job communicating what it's doing, and I hope to help figure out how we can achieve a more legible posture there.

I care a great deal about the quality of discourse and behavior of the community towards each other and people outside of it, and I hope to help continue to reinforce and normalize the Values so that we can all have a friendly place to do our best work.


## Q&A

### Should the SC vote for confidence instead of for no-confidence? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472))


The [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#full-reelections) reads:

> A simple majority within the SC may call a reelection of the entire SC based on perceived loss of confidence.

This can lead to a 3-3 deadlock as we [currently](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) [see](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/6). In this deadlock, neither the reelection, nor any majority vote can pass - the SC is unable to function.

**In many legislatures, this is flipped into a vote of confidence that must pass to avoid a re-election.** This would have the same results for a full SC, but avoid situations like the current 3-3 deadlock.

Do you support amending the constitution accordingly?

I believe the correct thing, in the case of deadlock, would be to allow the Board to cast the deciding vote--it's a boring solution that requires minimal involvement beyond the initial amendment.

### How would you handle an SC member joining Anduril? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190))


Recently, current SC member Tom Bereknyei took a new job at Anduril. After parts of the community [criticized](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971) the SC for not communicating this publicly, the SC gave a [statement](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/statement-on-a-steering-committee-member-joining-anduril/69007).

As an SC member, how would you like the SC to handle such a situation in the future?

*Please focus on the community aspects and be specific in what actions should be taken in such a scenario. This is not the place to discuss your opinion about the [MIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex).*

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190#issuecomment-3354766758">link</a>)</summary>

I don't care who people work for as long as they respectfully and competently discharge their duties as a member of the SC, and as long as they follow the code of conduct and Values.

I think it's incredibly invasive to require people to notify the community every time they change jobs--we're not collecting taxes, be real. Are we going to request SC members to disclose every time they conduct relations at Chaos Communications Congress with another consenting adult? How about every time they use a proprietary piece of software? Perhaps body cams? C'mon folks.

(As always, if you *do* care more about those things, *don't vote for me*! If you care more about performance and civility than constant surveillance, please *do* vote for me! Both are valid positions!)

Humor aside, I *do* think that for transparency on any vote disclosure of CoI is reasonable and should be required for anything other than an abstention.

I also don't think that that's an SC problem, unless we need to nudge the folks on our side to maybe look a bit at why that wiki is doing so well and how it differs (the history is [interesting](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_Wiki:History)).

Yes.

Communication should be monthly in the absolute worse case. We should nudge all teams to do the same, perhaps make a celebration of it.

At the start of the year, we should probably set standards for *what* needs to get included--the recent kerfluffle about job changes reflects a failure to do that.

### How would you treat SC members with completely opposite political leanings? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/489))


As the title suggests, if some SC members have completely different political affiliations and governance ideas than you, and often disagree with you on decision-making, how would you treat them? How would you ensure that you fulfill your responsibilities?

More seriously, if you find that the faction you represent is not the majority in the SC, what will you do?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/489#issuecomment-3368415553">link</a>)</summary>

We don't need to agree on everything--the process doesn't require unanimous votes to get everything done. I think arguing my point, voting my conscience (what people who vote for me should expect), and showing up reliably is a low and attainable bar.

None of this is life and death--it's a package manager and configuration language and the various fora around it, so there's no reason to freak out and start public pressure campaigns/name-calling/doxxing/leaks/etc. if somebody doesn't share my politics. If I were to lose a vote I care about, I'd go outside and touch grass.

We are all likely to lose some SC votes over politics at some time, probably. That's fine. Boring and natural, even.

### Community participant behaviour regarding moderation decisions ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/477))


**Scenario**: While being suspended by a decision from the moderation team, a suspended community participant mass mails other community participants about a community matter. The recipients did not all have an existing relationship, or a good-standing relationship with the suspended individual.

**Question**: What do you think of this behaviour? How do you characterize this in regard of the expected conduct, and the values of this community?

This question seems like "What if people we suspend send an email to people who have published their emails...presumably for the purpose of receiving email?". I don't really see an issue, though others perhaps guard their inboxes more jealously.

(FWIW, in my country we've had a lot of issues with news agencies being kicked out of government coverage because they're not liked by the establishment for whatever reason, so I'm naturally a bit sympathetic to the fourth estate.)

In the interest of transparency, the email in question:

### How transparent should the SC be? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407))


In a [blog post](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html), resigned SC member @Gabriella439 recommended future SCs to increase transparency toward the community. (A different recommendation there, regarding SC size, is the subject of #265.)

In particular, the argument for this went (non-header emphasis mine):

> **Poor self-organization and internal policies/procedures**

[...]

> I think one of the big mistakes we made was that we insisted on **“speaking with one voice”**, meaning that we could not make any meaningful external statements or comments without getting majority approval from the committee (something we had difficulty with on the regular). This is why the committee remained largely silent or slow-to-respond on a large number of issues.

> This problem got bad enough that at some point many members began to break the wall of silence by commenting in an unofficial capacity on high-profile issues so that outsiders would get some visibility into what was going on instead of waiting for us to completely the slow process of gathering enough consensus and votes.

> Another internal policy that I believe was counter-productive was **not disclosing the final votes** on various issues or requiring individual signatories on public statements. Had we done this it would have likely broken a lot of internal stalemates and filibusters if all committee members were held publicly accountable for their policy positions (and therefore subject to public pressure).

> It would have also helped with another issue, which was:

> **Absenteeism**

> For various reasons (some justifiable, some not), at many points in time a large number of committee members would be unreachable, even during crucial junctures like ongoing controversy. This absenteeism was masked by the committee not publicizing that fact earlier. **If we had required all votes to be publicly recorded and all statements to require individual signatories** it would have exposed this absenteeism earlier (and led to quicker corrections).

As such, I would like to ask SC candidates: how do you regard the topic of SC transparency in light of @Gabriella439's recommendations, if not more generally? Further, how would you concretely enact these views in the SC, if elected?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407#issuecomment-3354597507">link</a>)</summary>

Votes should be recorded publicly, minutes should be given monthly at worst.

The SC is fairly boring in what it does--secrecy I do not believe serves the interests of anybody. This isn't life or death.

If you elect me (or somebody else)  to represent your interests, I have no problem with an expectation that you see how I go about honoring your trust while discharging my duties!

### If mods are cops, who should decide on punishments? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464))


Related to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428 and the ongoing discussion on discourse about the resignation of the moderation team: https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828

I’ve seen different metaphors for what moderators are supposed to be. Some say moderators are like cops (enforcing rules), others say they’re like paramedics (helping people in crisis).

But no one has made the case for moderators as _judges_. If moderators are indeed tasked with enforcing rules, who then plays the role of the judiciary in our governance model? Do you think mods alone should be able to decide on the punishment (especially lifetime bans)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464#issuecomment-3357818286">link</a>)</summary>

First, let's all get on the same page.

* The existing Code of Conduct: https://github.com/NixOS/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
* The existing Values: https://nixos.org/values/

In particular, look at the bad behaviors enumerated by the CoC:

> Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
>    * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
>    * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
>    * Disrupting discussions and disingenuous discussion practices, including derailing, concern trolling, sea lioning and other bad faith arguments
>    * Public or private harassment
>    * Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
>    * Wasting other people’s time with low quality contributions, including but not limited to LLM and bot spam
>    * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

These are easy to identify to an external observer or to receive reports about, and having a documentation trail will help in cases where an appeal would need to be made. (The current and past moderation team didn't do that, by the way.)

This ease of identification also helps set expectations from the community: members and participants both know what's expected of them and know what they should be on the lookout for. It's not some dark art.

In terms of what the mods can actually do, reasonably:

* You can warn somebody (publicly) about an infraction--but if that happens more than once, you've probably got a serial offender.
* You can remove damaging information (for example, the CSAM spam we had, doxxing, slurs). This is largely janitorial work.
* You can ban a user.

More mature communities can perhaps have more flexibility there, but the toxicity here over the last few years suggests that a simple and legible and predictable set of enforcements is to be preferred. No amount of therapy is going to dissuade a dedicated troll. No amount of "bro just trust me bro we talked about it on DMs over Matrix and bro they pinkie-swore they didn't mean that and so it's okay" is going to help the community get critical visibility into actions and consequences.

All of this is easy to document and should be documented publicly: you don't *need* privacy if you're not playing therapist or social worker.

You have to have cops--we just get to decide if they're unaccountable secret police (as we have today, as have been apparently been attempting a coup against the elected SC) or if they're boring and predictable public servants who--while imperfect--can be expected to do a basically good job basically the same way basically all of the time.

### Should community-related Conflicts of Interest be considered for the SC election? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192))


The [constitution explicitly mentions](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#conflict-of-interest-coi-balance) "employees of the same company or otherwise the same payer for Nix work" as *examples* of Conflicts of Interest for the constitution of the SC.

In the current SC, we had three members of the Nix team (Ericson2314, roberth, tomberek) and two members of the commit bit delegation team (jtojnar, winterqt), which arguably reduces diversity as well.

Should team-memberships in the community also be considered as Conflicts of Interest for the SC election? Why (not)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3354754312">link</a>)</summary>

If a team is somehow able to organize themselves enough to campaign and take over the SC, more power to them and their initiative. The one exception to this is the mod team, due to their special authority to throw out users.

The incentive is ass-backwards for the proposed expansion, because it punishes people for getting involved in more teams.

(I'm more concerned that the current conception of CoI fails to account for things like being involved in competing implementations and communities, social media groups, country, military status, and so forth.)

In short, no, I don't think we should worry about team-based CoI (except for the moderation team). Keep it simple.

### What is the goal of community moderation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428))


What, in your opinion, is the goal of community moderation?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428#issuecomment-3354586463">link</a>)</summary>

Moderation consists of:

1. Preventing abuse of the community from without (e.g., the mass posting of CSAM that happened in Matrix some time ago).
2. Preventing abuse of the community from within (e.g., users doxxing each other in public spaces, calling each other slurs, organizing harassment of other users, and so forth.)
3. Preventing attacks on the legitimacy of the governing structures (no org can survive without this basic self-preservation mechanism).
4. **That's it.**

Towards this end: **mods are cops**.

They're not therapists, they're not politicians, they're not arbiters--they're cops who are given escalated permission to narrowly enforce the will of the project governance as written in the community code of conduct and (in our case) Values.

In exchange for this power, they're expected to:

1. Keep detailed public records on deliberation, investigation, and enforcement.
2. Be impartial and unbiased in their actions.
3. Intervene only in the handful of narrow ways approved by the governing body in the handful of narrow cases enumerated in the governing policies.
4. Follow the elected government's requests.

When mods try to do more, do it in secret, do it rogue, or do it to favor their friends and hurt their enemies *then* we have problems.

Moderation should be boring, and *everybody* should feel equally protected by them and able to understand their actions.

### How would you act on the moderation team's call to SC candidates? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/390))


When a large part of the moderation team [stepped down](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828) they asked for:

> **We call on the SC candidates:** to commit to implementing a Constitution reform that will require transparency and accountability from the SC, with teams like technical steering and moderation providing a counterbalance.

How would you act as a member of the next SC in this matter?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/390#issuecomment-3354607465">link</a>)</summary>

1. I'd find replacements for the mod team members that abandoned their post and started another mess on the forums.
2. I'd ask the community what they wanted from moderation and find replacements for them from the community.
3. If the community wanted oversight, I'd continue to provide it--and if they community wanted an unelected body (or, god help us, a bicameral situation with two separate elections), I'd do my best to implement that efficiently and to the community's satisfaction.

We can't have moderators stirring up drama, especially this close to an election--but we also need to make sure the community has a say in the cops they're subjected to.

Mostly, I'd try to get moderation to be boring and not something worthy of talking about.

### Stance on specific case of statements made by external actors ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/485))


The following was authored by @jaen but I'm posting it on their behalf because they cannot and I would like answers to it as well. The title of the issue was written by me.

---

The recent SC turmoil had been commented on outside the community in various venues. In particular, I'd like to draw attention to this [Twitter thread](https://xcancel.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1972037286192992320) where certain individuals talk about _“get[ting] these nut jobs out”_ and that _“[M]aybe @<!-- -->PalmerLuckey can help turn the ship around.”_ While the Anduril founder does not acknowledge those proposals directly, he says this:

> The good news is that Anduril will keep using Nix to build ever more powerful weapons for American dominance regardless of what the fringe "community" people say.

The question is, what is your stance on this thread — is it a nothingburger, or an indication of existential threat to community governance and self-sovereignity — and what steps, if any, do you plan to take to insulate the project against the threat, should it it materialise into something more concrete than online bickering.

And as a corollary to that, what does Nix governance and self-sovereignity means for you, do you feel it’s an important aspect for the SC to work towards and what would your be general policy to handle potential threats stemming from external actors looking to control the project to their own ends. Consider what limits — if any — you would seek to put on such a threat actor, how — if at all — could that extend to functions community members associated with them could perform at a maintainer and/or governance levels, for example to ensure the threat actor cannot pressure them into acting against the project's best interests.

### What should happen in the event of an SC member resigning early? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481))


The SC is currently elected by proportional representation, which seeks to reflect the preferences of its voters.
However, over this initial SC term we have seen multiple early resignations, potentially making what remains of the SC less representative of its voter base, if not also affecting [decision-making capabilities](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/some-procedural-clarifications-on-the-constitution/70278).

Now, there may be alternate ways to deal with scenarios involving early retirement, including going over the original votes to recalculate what alternate candidate might best represent this part of the electorate, or (eventually) even calling new elections.

As a candidate to the body in charge of our constitution, how would you ideally see these cases handled?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481#issuecomment-3367310699">link</a>)</summary>

If we do an automatic no-confidence vote or similar, it incentivizes campaigning to pressure people to resign if some faction feels things aren't going well. Schemes whereby the departing member may nominate a successor to carry out their term--presumably inheriting term limits and whatnot as well--are better but suffer from similar incentive problems. 

So, instead, let's make it unpalatable to quit for everyone involved: each departed member's vote should default to the board for bulk assignment as they see fit.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/195#issuecomment-3354731202">link</a>)</summary>

My priorities are:

* Transparency (public votes, public minutes, reliable monthly cadence) so that everybody knows what's up. This goes for the SC and *all* teams.
* Fresh moderation team, and removal of the old guard and constant community troublemakers. They're not happy, they haven't been happy, and they'll likely continue to be unhappy in ways that harm the community--so let's aid their transition. It worked for srid and jringer, it'll work for others.
* Getting progress made on any "boring" responsibilities that got sidetracked due to community and mod drama. The SC has work to do that isn't constant firefighting.

My goal is to get us to a point where there isn't a fresh dumpsterfire every week, whatever that takes. If you're tired of trashfires, vote for me or people similar to me.

If you don't like that, or think it's too heavy-handed, please vote for somebody else.

(And if I *can't* pull it off, you'll at least have a stack trace via the minutes.)

Everybody running feels strongly about serving the Nix community by running for election, but we also know that not all of us are going to get elected.

I'd like to ask if my colleagues would join me in publicly declaring their belief in an orderly and peaceful election and governance process. *Even if not elected, all of us can serve the community by setting a good example of behavior and decorum!*


### The Election Integrity Pledge:

>As a candidate for the Steering Committee, in order to demonstrate a good community spirit and trust, I hereby pledge that henceforth...
>
>* ...I believe that as a community we are here to do our best work and to ship code.
>* ...I support and celebrate the democratic nature of our elections.
> * ...if elected, I will dutifully and in good-faith participate in all SC work for as long as I have a seat.
> * ...elected or not, I will support the SC and the governance processes, and refrain from slandering or libeling SC members or candidates, or misrepresenting SC actions in public spaces.
> * ...I will not participate in, encourage, or aid public pressure campaigns against the SC, its members, or its candidates.
> * ...I will act with integrity and honor in the discharge of my duties.


If you agree, please reply simply with:

> I sign and support the Election Integrity Pledge.

Thank you.

### politics of tech and governing values ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487))


Whereas the existing Nix projects have licenses already, one popular adage states technology is not neutral - perhaps increasingly obviously so, as the impact of technology continues to grow.

As such, zooming out a bit, one of the topics the community has seen different takes on seems whether we should govern by certain values, as exemplified by actions such as the earlier open letter against MIC sponsorships, a sentiment that seemed represented among contributors, or 'keep politics out', a sentiment that has seemed represented more at e.g. the NixOS sub-reddit.

As a candidate, where do you stand on this? What values should we expect you to hold?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487#issuecomment-3367452367">link</a>)</summary>

I believe in More Nix for More People, and every time we add a political principle we partition the community and make work for ourselves. On some things this work is absolutely worth it, but in the majority of cases it is not--lots of heat, little light, and it drives away potential contributors and shrinks our tent.

I value the most compact working set of principles that allow people to do their best work and coexist relatively peacefully, and view every additional principle (say, derived from geopolitics) as something that by default will only harm our community either via outright othering, via ensuing debate and ugliness, or via unintended consequences. We need to be extremely conservative in what we adopt given how diverse our community is and how diverse we'd like it to be.

### Voter mechanisms to recall individual candidates ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482))


Over the past days, there have been [multiple](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971/) [calls](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/) for individual SC candidates to step down, or even calling for a [full reelection](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/).

Current procedures have yet to take into account such desires, meaning we would currently depend on either:

- SC members voting one another out (re: individual SC members)
- SC votes of no confidence (c.f. #472)

Would you rather see such a formal mechanism to retroactively retract/amend votes or recall individual delegates? If yes, what should this look like? If not, why not?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482#issuecomment-3367325947">link</a>)</summary>

I'm against this, because the incentives and resultant behavior are all wrong--we've already seen this with public pressure campaigns targeting particular members.

If the SC can't somehow manage to route around a bad member, we have bigger problems that removing one member won't fix. If it's multiple members, that's an issue for the yearly elections.

The boring thing is just to accept that you sometimes get a lemon, and you deal with them until the next election. Let's be boring.

### Who are "The Nix Community", and why? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/436))


One outcome of the NCA was the "Constitution", which advertises "Values". It falls short, however, of "constituting a community": it does not attempt to describe anything resembling a "membership predicate", a matter that was intensively discussed in the Governance Zulip. I'm interested in the candidates' reasoning and reflection about the community's composition, but here's also a few litmus tests:

- Are DetSys and Anduril "part of the community"?
- Is Jon Ringer "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Is srid "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Generally, how does moderation action affect "community membership"?
- Are former maintainers, who resigned in support of either of the two Open Letters, "part of the community"?
  - If they have not contributed back to the project since?
  - If they participate in discussions on Discourse or in Social Media?
  - If they contribute only to forks?
  - If they contribute to forks, but backport ad hoc?
- Are Lix, Snix, the Foundation, or the nix-community "part of the community"?
- Are NixCon Sponsors "part of the community"?
- Of participants of Nix-Offtopic and Discourse, are those, who do not "contribute" code, documentation, or decision-making, still "part of the community"?

Finally,

- Are people who disagree with the composition or the priorities of the "Values" part of the community?

Entities, both biological and legal, which use Nix and participate in official spaces according to our rules are the community. 

This is regardless of who they are, who they work for, who they identify as, or their opinions about the the implementation of things like the constitution or Values--everybody's free to an opinion.

The exceptions are entities who have declared they'd like to leave or who are engaging in hostile behavior or who have been banished by the mods--those entities (via self-selection or moderation) are basically either visitors, vandals, vagrants, or exiles.

The *ecosystem*, of course, is a superset including basically everyone that uses nix regardless of current community involvement and status.

I don't think a more exciting answer is particularly illuminating.

### How do you want to proceed with sponsorship policy? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/342))


Last year, one of the most important questions to people running for SC was sponsorship policy, in particular regarding MIC companies. Since then, there were some efforts on the SC side to draft a comprehensive sponsorship policy, and they also started approving/denying sponsors directly, without delegation to NixCon team.

Do you feel like SC taking on this job is adequate in the long run, or do you see it as a temporary measure? What are your next steps on pursuing a sponsorship policy?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/342#issuecomment-3354612845">link</a>)</summary>

I believe that the sponsorship policy should be minimal, simple, and easy to follow:

**If you're a legal entity, we'll take your money--but we explicitly do not endorse or condemn whatever you stand for. We appreciate your money, but we do not have any opinion, support, or condemnation for whatever other baggage you have.**


This is a nice, simple, boring metric and a nice, simple, boring claim to stake out. Anybody can do it, even us.

### How are you going to interact with Lix? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/283))


Lix is now a major part of the ecosystem, providing a non-commercial, production-ready alternative to Nix. It falls outside of governance power of SC, but coordination with it is of paramount importance for Nix development, security patching, and stability of Nixpkgs (as there have been numerous occasions where Lix has fixed a crucial bug that was preventing Nixpkgs work, while Nix hasn't). Historically, there has been hostility towards Lix and running it on NixOS Community infra.

How do you plan to structure your communication with Lix Project?

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/283#issuecomment-3354697832">link</a>)</summary>

Nix is for the Nix community.

The Lix folks wanted to split off and they did so--I wish them the best of luck on their journey, and I think we'd do well to share things like security issues, packages when easy,  and technical knowledge.

They've done interesting things with a different source control workflow (Gerrit, iirc), for example, and having a different implementation is a good way of keeping us honest via friendly competition.

But, at the end of the day, they left, and they're welcome to do whatever they want with their own resources--not ours.

(I feel similarly about DetSys' use of Nix resources.)

### How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197))


There is an [ongoing](https://discourse.nixos.org/search?q=Determinate%20Nix%20%23links%20in%3Atitle%20order%3Alatest) conflict between Determinate Systems and parts of the community. Some aspects of this, such as the "Nix the trademark" are likely things for the [foundation](https://github.com/nixos/foundation) to deal with.

However, Determinate Systems is *part of the community* as well, so this conflict also has aspects internal to the Nix community.

How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197#issuecomment-3354744927">link</a>)</summary>

The conflict around DetSys is the result of the same constellation of folks complaining every time DetSys posts anything, and then DetSys having a business model that benefits from the drama those users stir up.

The answer is not exciting:

If DetSys employees violate the code of conduct or Values, they get banned. If their critics do the same, those critics get banned. It may be worth leaning on the mods to lower the threshold for those threads to help speed the selection process.

Eventually, people will either learn to coexist or they'll be ejected. Our community looks like garbage to anybody outside of it every time one of these skirmishes breaks out...it's time to stop it.

There's no coherent policy that doesn't amount to "Fuck DetSys in particular" I believe we can implement, so this is the next best thing.

If that's not to your liking, don't vote for me or people like me.

### How should the SC deal with people in the org chart not respecting their authority? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/491))


This question is based on a question from the previous year: https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114
> **Title: What's the best way for the steering committee to deal with inaction or being ignored?**
> One of the main ways in which the previous Nix governance has been criticized is for ignoring or being inactive in the face of community protests and concerns.[1](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#user-content-fn-1-be51383cd9081764e2d5d66461ad8100)
> 
> Let's suppose that the steering committee is now responsive to the community... but when the steering committee asks for or directs action, that request is ignored, de-prioritized, or litigated by the relevant parties.
> 
> How would you as a single SC member deal with this? How would you ask for your fellow steering committee members to act as a group?

I would like to specifically add that the party in question might escalate the matter into the court of public opinion.

In the answers from the previous year there was a very clear dividing line among candidates about not only using explicit powers granted by the constitution, versus using activism.

Would you advocate for the SC using activism proactively?
Would you advocate for the SC using activism once a matter is moved into the court of public opinion?
How do you think the SC should react to activism?
At what point should the SC concede to activist pressures?

Adding to that footnote, I also don't mean to say this is hat happened recently or want to litigate specific recent events, I'm interested in other candidates general view on these kinds of issues.

> Adding to that footnote, I also don't mean to say this is hat happened recently or want to litigate specific recent events, I'm interested in other candidates general view on these kinds of issues.

First of all to set a baseline: this has 100% happened with the various leaks and letters and discourse posts and whatnot.

I won't ask people to agree with me as to whether this was right or wrong or deserved, simply that it in fact has happened.

> Would you advocate for the SC using activism proactively?

No, because activism invariably makes our community look toxic to outsiders and full of drama and because using it reinforces a *de facto* lack of faith in our processes.

> Would you advocate for the SC using activism once a matter is moved into the court of public opinion?

No, *because activism invariably makes our community look toxic to outsiders and full of drama and because using it reinforces a *de facto* lack of faith in our processes.*

> At what point should the SC concede to activist pressures?

Never, **because activism invariably makes our community look toxic to outsiders and full of drama and because using it reinforces a *de facto* lack of faith in our processes.**

(There is a pattern to my answers, one may notice.)

> How do you think the SC should react to activism?

If enough of the SC is annoyed by it, they should vote to punt the member in question out of the SC. If they're unable to do so, well, vote early and vote often next election cycle.

We want an SC that is boring, and members who use activism to get what they want are exciting--and so must go.

### What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to community and Foundation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337))


(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/34 from 2024 election)

What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to the community? Should they be linked on the homepage?

Unofficial spaces are by definition unofficial--they can run their houses how they see fit.

If an unofficial space is particularly large, it may be worth it to link out to them as we already do.

There's enough work to be done in the official spaces without the exciting prospect of getting involved elsewhere.

### How are you going to resolve S3 cache situation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/336))


S3 cache size continues to rise. AWS still pays the bills for it, but this part of infra is something that might need a look.

Latest updates on the topic that I could find were from about a year ago on the Discourse:

https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-06-06-re-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-6/46617
https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-07-10-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-7/48821

My understanding is that it's a complicated topic, where a lot of technical decisions need to be made, and Foundation needs to get a lot of talks with various potential partners, and this needs to be coordinated. Binary cache is a center piece of the infra, so its future needs to be well-secured; do you have any concrete steps in mind on how to proceed? Maybe coordinating with someone doing software archiving?

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/336#issuecomment-3354666250">link</a>)</summary>

In the short term, we need to be able to find trustworthy and cost-effective hosting and raise funds to cover it. I don't know enough right now to give a better answer there other than that we need to make it easy for *anybody* who wants to fund us to do so.

In the long term, we need to be searching for technical solutions that are decentralized and secure and mean we aren't relying on the charity of any company to keep us going.

### How can contributing to Nix-the-implementation be made easier? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196))


It has repeatedly been mentioned in the past, that contributing to [Nix](https://github.com/nixos/nix) is hard.

What are the reasons for this from your perspective and how can this be improved?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196#issuecomment-3354721380">link</a>)</summary>

Long-term, I think we should look at other implementations to see what we could be doing better. I also think that the current solution--being nearly two decades old--is worth taking a beat and doing cleanup on.

In my opinion, the SC should nudge the Nix team to:

* Break the logjam on accepting PRs. This is important for refactors to make things easier to hack on, and to increase morale on contributors of all tenures.
* Make a temporary pause on new work excepting documentation, code cleanup, and tooling. This should be strictly limited in length, 3 or 6 months.
* Coordinate with marketing and other teams to look for volunteers to help maintain Nix and bring in fresh blood.

Bluntly, more contributors means less pressure--political and otherwise--on the handful of folks doing the work. Many hands make light work, and that makes work boring.

### Should electoral alliances/coalitions count as conflicts of interest? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/479))


Related to #470.

It has been brought to my attention that several candidates are interested in forming electoral coalitions[^1] where candidates agree to vote for each other in time for the election. This could significantly change the result of the election, especially if coalitions decide to formalize which candidates they choose to vote for and which they do not, and if many members of the same coalition are elected to office, their shared interests could dominate the SC. In spite of this, there are currently no rules in place that will require electoral coalition/alliance status to be disclosed in each candidate's statement. 

Do you think participation in coalitions and alliances *has to be* disclosed? If not, do you think they *should* be disclosed?

[^1]: To be clear, *informal* alignments such as friendships do not count here — whether *those* should be counted as CoIs deserve a different issue altogether.

### How are you planning to pursue a trademark? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/340))


A trademark is direly needed, as there are many commercial projects who use "Nix" in their name for marketing purposes, sometimes confusingly. However, the trademark rules have to be reasonable for downstream users, and put clear guidelines. Furthermore, there might be conflicts if the trademark policy doesn't match a company's path. Additionally, it will require a clear set of guidelines between what each of Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS project constitutes, and how much "Nix" they share (possibly with renaming?)

How do you plan to handle this?

There were several decisions made by previous SC in response to community conflicts. They set an important benchmark to gauge candidate's decision-making. Those questions are:

    Allow Anduril to keep publishing jobs on Discourse?
    Replace PolyMC with Prism Launcher?
    What should be the policy on MIC participation?
    What should be the policy for telemetry?

What additional initiatives would you raise?

> Allow Anduril to keep publishing jobs on Discourse?

Any company that communicates in our official spaces following the code of conduct and Values is fine by me.

> Replace PolyMC with Prism Launcher?

I'm not really sure this is an SC problem, but ideally in most cases we should strive to offer as much software to people as possible, regardless of source, provided somebody is up for maintaining it and it wouldn't be an undue burden on us.

> What should be the policy on MIC participation?

Provided their behavior here follows the code of conduct and Values, they're community members like anybody else. There's no surer way of making things exciting and not boring than by getting pulled into that sort of debate.

> What should be the policy for telemetry?

Default off out of respect for users, but a polite "hey, do you want to help give info to us? here's what we'd like!" wouldn't be out of line for folks interested in giving back.

The title might seem excessively direct. However, last year, there was a question on MIC policy and Anduril ban. Since then, SC has enforced a ban on Anduril job posting. Anduril has been a very controversial company for the wide community; I feel like it's fitting to ask about another controversial company, and how to interact with it.

### What are your thoughts on documentation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/339))


Documentation is often cited as being lackluster, incomplete, or confusing. Personally, I disagree; I've seen many improvements to documentation over the years, and I think it has come a long way. Still, those improvements don't address the core issue for why documentation *feels* lackluster.

IMO, the issue is because the boundaries between projects are not clear. A new NixOS user will look at the NixOS manual for help: but really, they are using Nix+Nixpkgs+NixOS stack. For a beginner, it is not clear why there would be three manuals, and where the boundaries lie, and which manual they need (especially when interacting with a layering violation). This provides a frustrating experience, where despite the information being abundant, it is not at all discoverable in a relevant fashion.

Is this something that you are concerned with? What do you want to do with it? Direct more resources into cross-cutting documentation projects, like nix.dev or wiki.nixos.org ? Work on clearer project boundaries? Attempt to bridge documentation?

I am curious to hear your thoughts.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/339#issuecomment-3354638060">link</a>)</summary>

We should consolidate documentation in the official spaces wherever possible, and we should provide an annotated guide to the unofficial spaces to help people navigate more quickly.

We should also make it easy for newcomers to find what they're looking for, covering common use cases and soliciting requests for things we aren't already covering.

In the age of LLMs, we should also see what can be done to make it easier for folks getting AI-assistance to get *correct* answers about how to do things in our project. This might be hopeless, this might be just a matter of exporting things to markdown--but we should at least investigate it.

Docs should be boring to use and helpful to everyone regardless of skill level.

### How are you planning to reconcile conflicts between SC and Nix team? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/285))


Nix is a central piece of the ecosystem, and Nix team holds authority over it. Additionally, many Nix team members are a long-time, trusted community members, making them overwhelmingly more likely to be elected. One of the purposes of SC is to coordinate different teams; this poses a clear conflict of interest, when someone is in both Nix team and SC, as that person's interests as an SC member and Nix team member are not necessarily aligned.

How is such a conflict of interest planned to be addressed, or resolved?

I don't think there's anything to be done until we see this occur, at which point we already have mechanisms in place for handling CoI issues on the SC.

If the SC is public in its deliberations and the Nix team follows procedure, I don't really think anything exciting will happen. If the Nix team goes rogue, the SC should try to nudge them back to reasonableness--and if they can't, they should change the composition of the team. The only scenario I can see this being an issue is pretty straightforward to solve we tools we already have.

### What is your view on licensing? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/338))


Right now, the ecosystem is very split between permissive licenses (MIT), copyleft-ish licenses (LGLP, MPL), and copyleft licenses (GPL). This signifies a wider disagreement between people on what community is, and what to expect.

Licenses are by no means perfect, but they signify intention and direction. They are like a COC: adopting one doesn't instantly solve all of your problems (nor is expected to), but it shows where the project is heading. This has a lot of consequences later down the line. It could be argued that Nixpkgs being MIT-licensed is a reason why there are so many companies hanging around it; it could likewise be argued that the reason DetSys hasn't been more successful with their "downstream distribution" has to do with LGPL.

What is your view on licensing? Are you planning to put out guidelines for licensing official and community projects? Pursue relicensing various projects?

### How are you going to reform SC? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/284))


To me, SC results were disappointing. Despite the community having clearly cast their votes, not much of substance was achieved in a year. This is indicative of a "committee" situation: where consensus is required to make any decisions. This poses an existential threat to the effectiveness of SC, as SC is meant to represent very diverse parts of the community, that often have conflicting interests. Achieving consensus in such a case is a pipe dream.

That's why SC members need a lot more autonomy, to be able to make decisions on their own (overriden by majority, if significant opposition arises) and not get blocked by achieving impossible consensus. This is the entire purpose of SC, as consensus-driven decisions were made with RFCs, and ran into all the same issues.

Considering this, how would you reform the SC to allow for more individual action and autonomy?

The only reforms I believe in for the SC are to communicate more frequently (at least monthly), keep minutes, publish votes, and to act more aggressively if there's a clear issue with a team's behavior.

We have a system we developed, we're still getting feedback on its first year, and there's a difference between a "failed system" and a "system that doesn't do what I want".

We don't need the excitement of many more changes.

### What is a "competing implementation", and should being involved in one constitute a conflict of interest? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/456))


(This is a little targeted, though everyone is welcome to chime in with their thoughts, of course.)

In https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3354754312 you said that you're worried about the current definition of "conflict of interest" not including "being involved in competing implementations and communities, social media groups, country, military status, and so forth".

What is a "competing implementation" or "competing community" to you? What level of involvement would you consider significant enough to constitute CoI? What decisions are you expecting the SC to make where this CoI becomes an issue?

Also, once again, as a litmus test, would any of these people be considered to have a CoI?
- a Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc team member
- a Determinate Systems employee
- a Snix/Tvix/Lix/etc contributor
- a contibutor to both NixOS/nix and Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc
- a person present in Tvix/Snix/Lix/etc discussion spaces
- an Auxolotl/Ekala/etc contributor
- a contributor to both NixOS/nixpkgs and Ekala/Auxolotl/etc
- a person present in Auxolotl/Ekala/etc discussion spaces

Also, can you maybe name examples of social media groups or countries that would be considered to have a CoI, and why/when?

Yep!

 I could!

One of the big successes of the last year or two has been the landing (as I recall) of some funding from the [Sovereign Tech Fund](https://www.sovereign.tech/programs/fund), which is an explicitly European (and, to a lesser extent, German) initiative--and that explicitly has as a goal reducing American influence over European tech. That's a case where one might imagine a CoI on the nationality of who is involved in handling it.

One of the easy partitionings of the community is by country: there's the large European contingent (and of course, sub-groupings in there for our French friends, our Germans, our Swiss, and so forth), a large American contingent, and I'm led to understand a *very* large Chinese contingent that has been mostly underrepresented in governance.

If we were better about CoI there, I think it'd allow for greater diversity, and that's a nice and boring solution.

<summary>Currently sitting SC members running for reelection: why did you vote the way you did on a vote of no confidence on 2025-09-30? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/452">link</a>)</summary>

Today, [a reply by @jtojnar](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) on the whistleblowing post mentioned that the Steering Committee held a vote of no confidence today, 30 September 2025.

> Vote of no confidence of the entire SC 2025-09-30 (failed 3/6)
> * Ericson2314: -1
> * Gabriella439: +1

A "yes" vote to a vote of no confidence implies that the individual does not have trust in the SC. A "no" vote implies that there is still some trust left.

Why did you vote the way that you did?

<summary>If you are re-elected, how did you vote on previous issues? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/282">link</a>)</summary>

In a similar vein to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/256, opinions on past incidents present an important benchmark to judge candidate's moral and practical compass. This is even more important for existing SC members. SC has some out as a single front to make coordinated statements; I believe that to be an important mistake, that allows SC members to hide behind a bureaucratic body and avoid any kind of accountability. I believe it to be highly unfair. For that reason, I would like to know the historical votes of SC members on various issues.
