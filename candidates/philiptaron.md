## Conflict of interest disclosure

I'm employed by [Qumulo](https://www.qumulo.com) as a Principal Member of Technical Staff. We use Nix internally as part of our build and test processes.

## Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

**I'm running to make the Steering Committee transparent, present, and courageous.** I want the Nix community to be stable, kind, generous, diverse, and growing — and I have faith my work can help make that possible.

I'm heartsick by the ways in which the Nix community and its leadership **currently do not foster these values**. Rather than stability, there's often silence. Instead of kindness, there's an ethos of perfectionism leading to unkindness being a norm. Instead of generosity, there's deep suspicion. I'm sad at the ways in which diversity isn't honored but is discarded. And most importantly for the long-term health of the community, by the ways that growth is looked at with suspicion rather than delight.

My motivation for [accepting the endorsements](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/pull/238) of the diverse set of folks from around the community is to be part of changing that on the Steering Committee. I'm commited to working together for Nix and the Nix ecosystem to do good. My promise is to work to create an enduring leadership team that is responsive, humble, open, and courageous as it [implements the Nix values](https://nixos.org/values/).

## What I have done

I've been using Nix since the early days (2016), but I bounced off its complexity a few times. I'm indebted to the writing of [Graham Christensen](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/), of [Gabriella Gonzalez](https://www.haskellforall.com/2022/08/stop-calling-everything-nix.html), of [Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/blog/nix-flakes-2-2022-02-27/), and of [Jade](https://jade.fyi/blog/building-nix-derivations-manually/) to name just a few, whose work made Nix legible to me.

My very first contribution was [#252637](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/252637) back in August 2023, not so long ago! Since then, I've contributed about 250 PRs throughout Nixpkgs and its associated tools, focusing on Nixpkgs CI, the standard environment (`stdenv`), and internal refactoring for quality, performance, and readability.

But my biggest contributions aren't PRs. I've reviewed and helped merge over **800 PRs**, many of which I was the sole reviewer and merger. I'm proudest of unblocking significant stuck PRs like [@ShamrockLee's `lib.extendMkDerivation`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/234651): reviewing in depth, continuing to engage, and pushing for explicit decisions to merge or reject. I'm proud of being called "merge-happy"[^1]. That's putting my time and attention toward helping others' work actually benefit our enormous userbase. That's what I will do on the Steering Committee.

[^1]: As @wolfgangwalther called me. I'll gladly take the label, even though I _try_ to be judicious.

## What I'll do

With 5 of 7 seats up for election, real reform is possible. Here's what I'll work for:

### Transparency

The first key reform is transparency. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. 
The current SC too often says nothing when called on to speak. From outside, it looks like anticipatory coverup — and [those never work](https://kajsotala.substack.com/p/how-anticipatory-cover-ups-go-wrong). This lack of transparency breeds conspiratorial thinking and actual conspiracies.

Let's speak and show our work, even when it's in progress. I support mechanisms like [@niklaskorz's non-voting observers](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/blob/main/candidates/niklaskorz.md), published minutes, and voting records. I'll work to make transparency structural and permanent.

### Reducing absenteeism

Being available is the first part of the job. I can't force others to work, but I'll show up myself and propose mechanisms to unwedge things when people can't. Putting a clock on decisions and taking action requires courage, but creates massive, compounding positive outcomes.

### Allow public disagreement

While I love consensus, insisting on it creates leadership by lowest common denominator, paralysis, burnout, and silence when courage is needed. When consensus fails repeatedly, the only real choice is division or exile — and we've seen this over and over. There are all sorts of minority views in our community, and finding norms which include them, do not stifle them, but do not cater to them is absolutely key to creating a truly diverse community.

To heal the gap, we need to disagree and commit, sometimes publicly. Democracy is powered by both debate and voting, where the minority commits to staying in the body despite not ending on top of the vote, and the majority commits to continuing to include them in the next debate.

## How I'll do it

### By showing up

My record of reviewing and merging PRs is clear: I show up consistently, day after day, week after week. You can count on me to be part of _doing the work_, whatever the work of the day is.

### By being courageous _and_ judicious

I'm merge-happy. I'm willing to "send it", and I'm willing to admit when I'm wrong and be the one clicking the revert button. Though it's not my favorite thing, I'm happy to be wrong in public, especially when the alternative is never speaking at all. But I also value thoughtfulness and due diligence, as evidenced by the review feedback I write. Courage _and_ caution are part of the best of us. I'll use them on the Steering Committee.

### By supporting and empowering others

The SC's job isn't to do the work itself, but to ensure an environment where the best work can be done. That means creating structures like the [Nixpkgs Core Team](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/establishing-the-nixpkgs-core-team/69743) and actually supporting what they do with alacrity rather than suspicion. That includes feedback but not micromanagement or nitpicking.

Yes, that absolutely includes empowering the moderation team to do their essential work without treating moderation like a software program with bugs. The recent decision to interfere with the moderation team is an unforced error, and I would never have voted in favor of it.

### By focusing on Nixpkgs

Nixpkgs is the crown jewel of the Nix ecosystem. While Eelco's PhD thesis is brilliant, most insightful PhD works remain insights without impact. But the impact of Nixpkgs is enormous. It's a repository where almost all open source software from almost every ecosystem exists in a continuously buildable state. There's no reason to suspect that given Nix-the-tool, Nixpkgs would necessarily result or remain as coherent as it has.

More than any other factor, Nixpkgs makes me believe in the greater Nix ecosystem.

Making sure Nixpkgs remains healthy amid proliferating evaluators, installers, operating systems, and supply chain threats is my most important technical priority. I'll accomplish this not through my own work, but by making sure those doing the work have what they need.

## Closing statement

Nix-the-idea and Nixpkgs-the-reality have changed how we experience software daily. Yet in the grander scope, we've yet to make an impact. I believe adopting Nix will impact the software ecosystem as profoundly as the integrated circuit impacted hardware. Packaging unlocks latent value trapped in silos. In a world where humans aren't the only code authors, it enables safety amid exponentially more churn.

I want to be part of that. I want to help lead that. With your vote, I promise I'll do my part to make real the promise of Nix.
