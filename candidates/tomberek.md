### Conflict of interest disclosure

I helped found Flox and worked there, now I work for Anduril.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

My goal is to promulgate Nix/NixOS by using the network effects of large-scale adoption.

### What I have done

I am part of the inaugural Steering Committee where we established how we would work together, served as an escalation point for decisions, [founded](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/formalize-creation-of-the-stdenv-team/54232) [multiple](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/establishing-the-nixpkgs-core-team/69743) [teams](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/creation-of-the-nixos-hardware-team/63974), executed a [formalized sponsorship program](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/nixcon.md#sponsorship-process), and [performed oversight functions](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828) for the community. I have established trust with much of the community, forged coalitions, and have a record of being able to work broadly across the ecosystem to address issues. I've also worked on increasing the Nix contributor base, mentored Nixpkgs contributors, and helped organize Nix-focused [conferences](https://planetnix.com/) [and](https://nix.vegas/) [events](https://dmvnix.org/).

### What I will do

I will continue to create and organize events, try to establish partnerships and sponsorships, and work toward creating a sustainable Nix ecosystem.


## Q&A

### Should the SC vote for confidence instead of for no-confidence? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472))


The [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#full-reelections) reads:

> A simple majority within the SC may call a reelection of the entire SC based on perceived loss of confidence.

This can lead to a 3-3 deadlock as we [currently](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) [see](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/6). In this deadlock, neither the reelection, nor any majority vote can pass - the SC is unable to function.

**In many legislatures, this is flipped into a vote of confidence that must pass to avoid a re-election.** This would have the same results for a full SC, but avoid situations like the current 3-3 deadlock.

Do you support amending the constitution accordingly?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472#issuecomment-3384089963">link</a>)</summary>

I am currently against this motion. This is a weakly held position and I welcome discussion about it. My reasoning so far is that a deadlock is only a crisis if critical matters must be attended to and there is no way to work together to make non-controversial votes. This question also assumes that all topics are evenly divided and that any one block is purely intent on creating a deadlock. This isn't true at the moment and isn't true in general. The SC can still make progress by finding compromises and proposals that gain broader approval.

### How would you handle an SC member joining Anduril? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190))


Recently, current SC member Tom Bereknyei took a new job at Anduril. After parts of the community [criticized](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971) the SC for not communicating this publicly, the SC gave a [statement](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/statement-on-a-steering-committee-member-joining-anduril/69007).

As an SC member, how would you like the SC to handle such a situation in the future?

*Please focus on the community aspects and be specific in what actions should be taken in such a scenario. This is not the place to discuss your opinion about the [MIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex).*

+1 to @rhendric's https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190#issuecomment-3367274335

This happened [earlier this year](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971/58) when I disclosed to the SC a week prior and updated my LinkedIn on the day of. There had been other changes of employment in the SC before, but those had not been advertised either; we had a poor precedent. Going forward, I do think it is a good idea maintain the public posting of employment.

Regarding additional disclosure, once we can regularly [publish meeting notes](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-meeting-2025-10-08-17-00-utc/70609) there would be advance notice to the community. I also agree with @philiptaron's suggestion:

> Had I been in the current SC's shoes, I would have strongly urged Tom to disclose this in a post on Discourse, and to encourage the moderation team to ensure that the community follow through on the [values of respect and civility](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/values.md#respect-and-civility) as they responded to the news.

A more complicated situation can also arise. Because Anduril is always trying to hire for Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS expertise, and because I am one of the hiring managers for these roles, it is plausible that while I am on the SC another member is hired to Anduril. First, I would initially have to maintain confidentiality, until an agreement is made. Then, this would trigger a [CoI Balance](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#conflict-of-interest-coi-balance) issue. I'd consult with our Constitutional Scholar @7c6f434c for how to handle the situation during an election (the paragraph is hard for me to parse), but otherwise it is clear that there is a hard limit of two from any CoI. Considering the sensitivity of this topic; I would seriously consider offering a resignation and special election to alleviate any concerns.

### Should the Steering Committee keep and publish meeting minutes? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/434))


Should the Steering Committee keep and publish meeting minutes?

Meeting minutes are, in short, a way of recording any decisions and discussion that occurred during a meeting.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/434#issuecomment-3380054072">link</a>)</summary>

The current SC took the advice of the NCA to speak with one voice. This means internal communications were not to be made public. This did allow us to build up trust; at first there was very little and over time we had much more, or so I thought. Then that trust was completely shattered. Lesson learned.

Yes. I strongly recommend that the SC change its practice and publish meeting minutes. This helps make our actions accountable, transparent, and communicates our intent to lead.

### Should Nix transition away from GitHub to a self-hosted git forge? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/326))


(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/18 from the 2024 election)

Do you believe Nix should move away from GitHub and instead host its independent Git forge? If so, what are the benefits and challenges of such a transition, and how would you approach this shift if it were to happen?

If you already answered last year, it would probably totally be fine to just copy that answer.

### Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265))


In https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html, current SC member Gabriella argues that 7 members are too many for the SC to operate efficiently and effectively.

With the experience we made after one year: Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265#issuecomment-3384065649">link</a>)</summary>

No.

This was brought up by Gabriella in various ways throughout September and early October. A [formal vote](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/should-the-size-of-the-sc-be-reduced-to-5-members/69561/5) for this failed. (It required 5 votes to pass.) My reasons for voting against it are:
- absenteeism: it is much harder to deal with temporary missing members, especially if it is more than one
- fragility: the potential for undue influence or damage caused by any one person is potentially much greater
- representation: this makes the stagger mechanism in the constitution more awkward

### absenteeism
I prefer fixing the process and there being less stigma in stepping down; everyone is a volunteer and they should not feel stuck. Things like better tracking of attendance, easier special elections, delegation, and other measures can play a part in reducing the impact of this problem. The current SC had what I would call poor attendance. This a summary of attendance from mid-spring:

### fragility
The impact of any one member is greater with 5 members. This increases the influence of any one person. Even a single person absent creates a vacuum and the chance of stagnation increases.

### representation
The stagger mechanism would be more coarse, with 2 or 3 new members each election. This introduces more representation irregularities than with a 7 member body.

### How would you treat SC members with completely opposite political leanings? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/489))


As the title suggests, if some SC members have completely different political affiliations and governance ideas than you, and often disagree with you on decision-making, how would you treat them? How would you ensure that you fulfill your responsibilities?

More seriously, if you find that the faction you represent is not the majority in the SC, what will you do?

> if some SC members have completely different political affiliations and governance ideas than you, and often disagree with you on decision-making, how would you treat them? How would you ensure that you fulfill your responsibilities?

The simple answer is that we treat people with [respect and civility](https://nixos.org/values/). The longer answer is that I am happy to work with anyone in the community in a professional manner and strive to find common points of agreement. I have done this in my first 1-year term. I probably have different political affiliations than @Ericson2314 and @roberth, but we do agree about some aspects of governance. We've never really discussed politics, and that's the point. Instead of focusing on differences, I would like to focus on common points of agreement so that we can work towards a common goal.

> More seriously, if you find that the faction you represent is not the majority in the SC, what will you do?

This is the position I found myself in this last year. I showed that I could forge a coalition that can agree on some goals and outcomes, despite our differences.

### How transparent should the SC be? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407))


In a [blog post](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html), resigned SC member @Gabriella439 recommended future SCs to increase transparency toward the community. (A different recommendation there, regarding SC size, is the subject of #265.)

In particular, the argument for this went (non-header emphasis mine):

> **Poor self-organization and internal policies/procedures**

[...]

> I think one of the big mistakes we made was that we insisted on **“speaking with one voice”**, meaning that we could not make any meaningful external statements or comments without getting majority approval from the committee (something we had difficulty with on the regular). This is why the committee remained largely silent or slow-to-respond on a large number of issues.

> This problem got bad enough that at some point many members began to break the wall of silence by commenting in an unofficial capacity on high-profile issues so that outsiders would get some visibility into what was going on instead of waiting for us to completely the slow process of gathering enough consensus and votes.

> Another internal policy that I believe was counter-productive was **not disclosing the final votes** on various issues or requiring individual signatories on public statements. Had we done this it would have likely broken a lot of internal stalemates and filibusters if all committee members were held publicly accountable for their policy positions (and therefore subject to public pressure).

> It would have also helped with another issue, which was:

> **Absenteeism**

> For various reasons (some justifiable, some not), at many points in time a large number of committee members would be unreachable, even during crucial junctures like ongoing controversy. This absenteeism was masked by the committee not publicizing that fact earlier. **If we had required all votes to be publicly recorded and all statements to require individual signatories** it would have exposed this absenteeism earlier (and led to quicker corrections).

As such, I would like to ask SC candidates: how do you regard the topic of SC transparency in light of @Gabriella439's recommendations, if not more generally? Further, how would you concretely enact these views in the SC, if elected?

Let's do more [meeting notes](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-meeting-2025-10-08-17-00-utc/70609) as it makes it easier to hold people accountable and to ensure they keep their word.

### If mods are cops, who should decide on punishments? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464))


Related to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428 and the ongoing discussion on discourse about the resignation of the moderation team: https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828

I’ve seen different metaphors for what moderators are supposed to be. Some say moderators are like cops (enforcing rules), others say they’re like paramedics (helping people in crisis).

But no one has made the case for moderators as _judges_. If moderators are indeed tasked with enforcing rules, who then plays the role of the judiciary in our governance model? Do you think mods alone should be able to decide on the punishment (especially lifetime bans)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464#issuecomment-3380142248">link</a>)</summary>

The Debian community splits these roles. One group is focused on community health, but they have no power. They have no "hard power" as @philiptaron mentions. Only "soft power". They are respected and have built a reputation of being fair. They've earned respect. They can only provide recommendations to another group to conduct any bans. Their recommendation has great weight, but it does provide a natural check/balance mechanism. I'm not sure if this is an overall a net positive or negative, but was something interesting I've come across.

Let's use the advice of professional moderation experts to bootstrap how to do this the correctly. No need to re-invent the wheel. The SC is trying to do this right now.

Nix allows for many "superpowers" when it comes to managing and deploying software. I particularly love the ability to encode and accept technical debt in an explicit way. This makes it clear and obvious what it is.

### Should community-related Conflicts of Interest be considered for the SC election? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192))


The [constitution explicitly mentions](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#conflict-of-interest-coi-balance) "employees of the same company or otherwise the same payer for Nix work" as *examples* of Conflicts of Interest for the constitution of the SC.

In the current SC, we had three members of the Nix team (Ericson2314, roberth, tomberek) and two members of the commit bit delegation team (jtojnar, winterqt), which arguably reduces diversity as well.

Should team-memberships in the community also be considered as Conflicts of Interest for the SC election? Why (not)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3384120490">link</a>)</summary>

I'm in agreement with [@philiptaron's reasoning](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3349398326). We should consider participation in broad responsibilities an asset, not a liability. The question uses the phrase "Conflicts of Interest" which has only a negative connotation; I would be in full agreement with "Should community team-memberships be considered for the SC election."

Specifically about the Nix Team. I am considering stepping down and to bring in others to contribute to Nix. One of our goals over the past few years has been to increase the team's contributor base. I mostly worked on that and assisting with security remediation rather than specific technical contribution. Recent participation and progress seems to be excellent and I hope to see it continue:

As an additional note regarding team representation: there was a concept that had a shaky start in 2024 and hasn't quite caught on yet, a [Nix teams gathering](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2025-02-13-nix-teams-gathering-meeting-minutes/60263) where various teams could come together and coordinate.

### What is the goal of community moderation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428))


What, in your opinion, is the goal of community moderation?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428#issuecomment-3380099018">link</a>)</summary>

I will +1 @djacu's statement:

```
The goal of community moderation is to foster a safe, welcoming, and constructive environment where people can engage productively. It is about enabling the community to function in line with its shared values and purpose. Responsibilities should include but are not limited to:

- Preventing harassment, abuse, or harmful behavior
- Reducing noise, spam, or disruptive behavior
- Being ambassadors of the values in the way they interact with the community
- Helping new members learn the culture and expectations
```

-----------------------------------

I will add another aspect. The current SC came to the majority agreement that the community's moderation activity exhibited significant bias. This led to additional oversight and led to a mass-resignation as we tried to correct for it. Mistakes were made. Luckily, the community has started to self-moderate and tell toxic behavior, "we don't do that here". Keep doing this. Be calm, but not silent.

Let's not try to re-invent the wheel. Take our historical lessons and the advice of professional moderation experts to bootstrap a proper moderation culture. The SC is currently doing this and will continue this effort into the next SC.

### Stance on specific case of statements made by external actors ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/485))


The following was authored by @jaen but I'm posting it on their behalf because they cannot and I would like answers to it as well. The title of the issue was written by me.

---

The recent SC turmoil had been commented on outside the community in various venues. In particular, I'd like to draw attention to this [Twitter thread](https://xcancel.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1972037286192992320) where certain individuals talk about _“get[ting] these nut jobs out”_ and that _“[M]aybe @<!-- -->PalmerLuckey can help turn the ship around.”_ While the Anduril founder does not acknowledge those proposals directly, he says this:

> The good news is that Anduril will keep using Nix to build ever more powerful weapons for American dominance regardless of what the fringe "community" people say.

The question is, what is your stance on this thread — is it a nothingburger, or an indication of existential threat to community governance and self-sovereignity — and what steps, if any, do you plan to take to insulate the project against the threat, should it it materialise into something more concrete than online bickering.

And as a corollary to that, what does Nix governance and self-sovereignity means for you, do you feel it’s an important aspect for the SC to work towards and what would your be general policy to handle potential threats stemming from external actors looking to control the project to their own ends. Consider what limits — if any — you would seek to put on such a threat actor, how — if at all — could that extend to functions community members associated with them could perform at a maintainer and/or governance levels, for example to ensure the threat actor cannot pressure them into acting against the project's best interests.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/485#issuecomment-3380304070">link</a>)</summary>

I lead the Nix Team at Anduril and have a significant say in the interaction with the Nix/NixOS community which I have been a contributor to for over a dozen years. No, Anduril's usage of Nix is not an existential threat to the project. My goal is to ensure our community thrives. It is what I've committed a significant amount of my life to.

I have conformed with the decisions made by the Steering Committee regarding these matters and have not broken that trust. 

I have also taken the following steps to insulate the project from undue influence:

- https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-meeting-2025-10-05-21-00-utc/70418
- https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/43
- https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/17#issuecomment-2381446857

I am quite comfortable leaving a job if I am asked to do something I consider a breach of my integrity. I've done it before.

-------------------------------------
> And as a corollary to that, what does Nix governance and self-sovereignity means for you, do you feel it’s an important aspect for the SC to work towards and what would your be general policy to handle potential threats stemming from external actors looking to control the project to their own ends.

Oh, yes. We need to create a community that can protect itself from internal and external actors that would abuse the project to pursue non-relevant goals. My general policy is to ensure we grow enough that no one actor can control us.

### What should happen in the event of an SC member resigning early? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481))


The SC is currently elected by proportional representation, which seeks to reflect the preferences of its voters.
However, over this initial SC term we have seen multiple early resignations, potentially making what remains of the SC less representative of its voter base, if not also affecting [decision-making capabilities](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/some-procedural-clarifications-on-the-constitution/70278).

Now, there may be alternate ways to deal with scenarios involving early retirement, including going over the original votes to recalculate what alternate candidate might best represent this part of the electorate, or (eventually) even calling new elections.

As a candidate to the body in charge of our constitution, how would you ideally see these cases handled?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481#issuecomment-3380194692">link</a>)</summary>

Being elected to the SC is a duty. It is a promise to fulfill the term you have been voted for. Resigning should be possible, because there are extraneous circumstances. In that situation the constitution describes a [special election](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#special-elections). 

There has been discussion regarding fixing the 6-person deadlock situation. There are multiple proposals to fix this and I'm not yet sure which is the best. Until we have a fix, I will work with the rest of the SC and attempt to reach majority votes by finding areas of agreement.
</details>

### How should the SC communicate with the community? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199))


The [list of official announcements](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/announcements/steering-committee/57) from the first year of SC starts with two general updates in November and December 24, then continues with only specific announcement on certain topics. Even if a bit delayed, the Foundation has given [more updates](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/meta/nixos-foundation/47).

Arguably there was not much insight for the community into what the SC was working on.

How would an SC with you as a member, communicate with the community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199#issuecomment-3384290641">link</a>)</summary>

I am in full agreement with every word of [@philiptaron's answer](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199#issuecomment-3352199091). Thanks for saving me the time to type!

As a small way to demonstrate progress towards more transparency, I have been trying to bring in more observers and publishing of votes and meeting notes:
- https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-meeting-2025-10-05-21-00-utc/70418

### What would be some concrete steps you would take in the first few months? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/195))


Please mention some concrete steps you would take in the first few months after being elected to the SC.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/195#issuecomment-3384230178">link</a>)</summary>

## Establish better organizational processes
This takes many forms; we have learned a great deal about what works and what doesn't. For example, the SC is getting better at publishing notes and I encourage this to continue:
    - https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-meeting-2025-10-05-21-00-utc/70418
    - https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-meeting-2025-10-08-17-00-utc/70609

## Healing and a Pledge
The SC and others are looking to engage with a mediator (see notes above) and start the process of talking, communicating, and healing. This is not easy. It is hard work to rebuild trust. It takes time, repeated engagements, and small steps. I pledge to do this work - with or without being elected to the next SC - and I ask everyone involved in the last few weeks to do the same.

## Interim moderation structure
I hope to bootstrap a moderation team or at least set up the next SC for success. In the interim, the community has done a fairly good job of self-moderating considering the sudden lack of a fully staffed moderation team. That is encouraging to see, thank you everyone!

## Guide the project and set the project direction
This is the [first responsibility of the SC](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#detailed-responsibilities) and is the leadership that we have been needing for many years. A technical roadmap has been in the works for some time, but always sidelined due to some crisis or another. Once the higher-priority issues with process and moderation are in good shape, we should steer.

### Would you join in an Election Integrity Pledge? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/488))


Everybody running feels strongly about serving the Nix community by running for election, but we also know that not all of us are going to get elected.

I'd like to ask if my colleagues would join me in publicly declaring their belief in an orderly and peaceful election and governance process. *Even if not elected, all of us can serve the community by setting a good example of behavior and decorum!*


### The Election Integrity Pledge:

>As a candidate for the Steering Committee, in order to demonstrate a good community spirit and trust, I hereby pledge that henceforth...
>
>* ...I believe that as a community we are here to do our best work and to ship code.
>* ...I support and celebrate the democratic nature of our elections.
> * ...if elected, I will dutifully and in good-faith participate in all SC work for as long as I have a seat.
> * ...elected or not, I will support the SC and the governance processes, and refrain from slandering or libeling SC members or candidates, or misrepresenting SC actions in public spaces.
> * ...I will not participate in, encourage, or aid public pressure campaigns against the SC, its members, or its candidates.
> * ...I will act with integrity and honor in the discharge of my duties.


If you agree, please reply simply with:

> I sign and support the Election Integrity Pledge.

Thank you.

I sign and support the Election Integrity Pledge.

With a caveat about what "we are here to do". I propose that we are here for this Purpose as described in the [Foundation by-laws](https://github.com/NixOS/foundation/blob/master/by-laws/Oprichtingsakte_NixOsFoundation.en.pdf):

> The purpose of the foundation is: to develop, propagate, and promote the adoption of a purely functional software deployment model and to support open-source projects that implement that model, as well as other activities that relate to, pertain to, and/or can be conducive to the foregoing in the broadest sense.

### Voter mechanisms to recall individual candidates ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482))


Over the past days, there have been [multiple](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971/) [calls](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/) for individual SC candidates to step down, or even calling for a [full reelection](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/).

Current procedures have yet to take into account such desires, meaning we would currently depend on either:

- SC members voting one another out (re: individual SC members)
- SC votes of no confidence (c.f. #472)

Would you rather see such a formal mechanism to retroactively retract/amend votes or recall individual delegates? If yes, what should this look like? If not, why not?

### Who are "The Nix Community", and why? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/436))


One outcome of the NCA was the "Constitution", which advertises "Values". It falls short, however, of "constituting a community": it does not attempt to describe anything resembling a "membership predicate", a matter that was intensively discussed in the Governance Zulip. I'm interested in the candidates' reasoning and reflection about the community's composition, but here's also a few litmus tests:

- Are DetSys and Anduril "part of the community"?
- Is Jon Ringer "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Is srid "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Generally, how does moderation action affect "community membership"?
- Are former maintainers, who resigned in support of either of the two Open Letters, "part of the community"?
  - If they have not contributed back to the project since?
  - If they participate in discussions on Discourse or in Social Media?
  - If they contribute only to forks?
  - If they contribute to forks, but backport ad hoc?
- Are Lix, Snix, the Foundation, or the nix-community "part of the community"?
- Are NixCon Sponsors "part of the community"?
- Of participants of Nix-Offtopic and Discourse, are those, who do not "contribute" code, documentation, or decision-making, still "part of the community"?

Finally,

- Are people who disagree with the composition or the priorities of the "Values" part of the community?

### How do you want to proceed with sponsorship policy? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/342))


Last year, one of the most important questions to people running for SC was sponsorship policy, in particular regarding MIC companies. Since then, there were some efforts on the SC side to draft a comprehensive sponsorship policy, and they also started approving/denying sponsors directly, without delegation to NixCon team.

Do you feel like SC taking on this job is adequate in the long run, or do you see it as a temporary measure? What are your next steps on pursuing a sponsorship policy?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/342#issuecomment-3380426623">link</a>)</summary>

This year the SC executed a [sponsorship](https://2025.nixcon.org/sponsorship/) effort and procedure that was quite effective. @winterqt and I ran the SC's component along with the local organizers. The [process](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/nixcon.md#sponsorship-process) can use some improvement to speed things up, but overall it worked quite well and we avoided any serious flare-ups. Well done!

### How should the SC deal with people in the org chart not respecting their authority? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/491))


This question is based on a question from the previous year: https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114
> **Title: What's the best way for the steering committee to deal with inaction or being ignored?**
> One of the main ways in which the previous Nix governance has been criticized is for ignoring or being inactive in the face of community protests and concerns.[1](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#user-content-fn-1-be51383cd9081764e2d5d66461ad8100)
> 
> Let's suppose that the steering committee is now responsive to the community... but when the steering committee asks for or directs action, that request is ignored, de-prioritized, or litigated by the relevant parties.
> 
> How would you as a single SC member deal with this? How would you ask for your fellow steering committee members to act as a group?
>
> [1]: I'm not interested in rehashing or re-litigating these specific cases or people involved; please do not do so in your answer. [↩](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#user-content-fnref-1-be51383cd9081764e2d5d66461ad8100)

I would like to specifically add that the party in question might escalate the matter into the court of public opinion.

In the answers from the previous year there was a very clear dividing line among candidates about not only using explicit powers granted by the constitution, versus using activism.

Would you advocate for the SC using activism proactively?
Would you advocate for the SC using activism once a matter is moved into the court of public opinion?
How do you think the SC should react to activism?
At what point should the SC concede to activist pressures?

Adding to that footnote, I also don't mean to say this is hat happened recently or want to litigate specific recent events, I'm interested in other candidates general view on these kinds of issues.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/491#issuecomment-3379960008">link</a>)</summary>

I've answered this [before](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#issuecomment-2395243617). I'll add that I've come to appreciate the value of what @philiptaron describes - establishing relationships and building trust as the means of earning respect. I hope I have earned some this last year on the SC and in the last decade of my involvement.

The rest is about "activism":

> Would you advocate for the SC using activism proactively?

Hard no. This is what has caused so many problems and created undue harm and stress to the community.

> Would you advocate for the SC using activism once a matter is moved into the court of public opinion?

Again, no. This has horrendous outcomes. Consider that we got exactly what [previous](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#issuecomment-2393679434) [was said](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#issuecomment-2391769486) in the previous election. This causes real pain and harm to specific individuals and the community at large.

> How do you think the SC should react to activism?

Just say "no". It actually [works](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971/58)! Once you say [no](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/25), the absurdity of the activism becomes apparent. Note the pattern used by activists; cause chaos, then point to that chaos as the reason to get what they want. That is not leadership.

> At what point should the SC concede to activist pressures?

Just say "no". One of the hallmarks of a bully is that they are often willing to escalate beyond what most civil people are willing to do in response. So there needs to be some spark, some courage, some duty to stand up to this. Otherwise others will be subject to that behavior as well. Conceding too much leads to a cycle of abuse.

### What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to community and Foundation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337))


(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/34 from 2024 election)

What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to the community? Should they be linked on the homepage? If so, should they be compelled to comply with the Foundation's code of conduct? Should we attempt to convert these communities into official spaces (if so, at what point)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337#issuecomment-3380502807">link</a>)</summary>

I am a moderator on the unofficial Discord. I would recuse myself from SC decisions about this. (previous answer: https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/34#issuecomment-2381449870)

- It would be great to be included on the homepage as that platform is sometimes convenient for beginners.
- No, we would not like to be compelled to comply with the Foundation's policies. 
- No, attempting to convert the communities would backfire. (here I changed my mind from the 2024 answer) Having separate spaces has it's own value and provides a "fire break' between the spaces.

### How are you going to resolve S3 cache situation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/336))


S3 cache size continues to rise. AWS still pays the bills for it, but this part of infra is something that might need a look.

Latest updates on the topic that I could find were from about a year ago on the Discourse:

https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-06-06-re-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-6/46617
https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-07-10-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-7/48821

My understanding is that it's a complicated topic, where a lot of technical decisions need to be made, and Foundation needs to get a lot of talks with various potential partners, and this needs to be coordinated. Binary cache is a center piece of the infra, so its future needs to be well-secured; do you have any concrete steps in mind on how to proceed? Maybe coordinating with someone doing software archiving?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/336#issuecomment-3388590635">link</a>)</summary>

This problem is not trivial, otherwise we would have solved it by now. So the levers the SC has to solve this problem are; to advise, create a temporary team, and to arrange any necessary funding.

Other approaches at a solution. Grow the user base, grow the number of people who rely on Nix and increase the amount of funding we have. Spend the time to create partnerships so that there are cache-mirrors and pass-through caches that relieve pressure on our infrastructure. Create smarter substitution mechanism in Nix itself. It might be possible to grow out of the problem.

### How are you planning to pursue a trademark? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/340))


A trademark is direly needed, as there are many commercial projects who use "Nix" in their name for marketing purposes, sometimes confusingly. However, the trademark rules have to be reasonable for downstream users, and put clear guidelines. Furthermore, there might be conflicts if the trademark policy doesn't match a company's path. Additionally, it will require a clear set of guidelines between what each of Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS project constitutes, and how much "Nix" they share (possibly with renaming?)

How do you plan to handle this?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/340#issuecomment-3380457669">link</a>)</summary>

### How are you planning to reconcile conflicts between SC and Nix team? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/285))


Nix is a central piece of the ecosystem, and Nix team holds authority over it. Additionally, many Nix team members are a long-time, trusted community members, making them overwhelmingly more likely to be elected. One of the purposes of SC is to coordinate different teams; this poses a clear conflict of interest, when someone is in both Nix team and SC, as that person's interests as an SC member and Nix team member are not necessarily aligned.

How is such a conflict of interest planned to be addressed, or resolved?

c.f. #258 

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/285#issuecomment-3388605607">link</a>)</summary>

This is not a problem because the Nix Team members' interests should aligned with the SC's and we should trust the voters to select for the proper diversity in the SC. I can see it being more complex if the conflict of interest was with SC/DetSys, or SC/Lix.

### Currently sitting SC members running for reelection: why did you vote the way you did on a vote of no confidence on 2025-09-30? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/452))


Today, [a reply by @jtojnar](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) on the whistleblowing post mentioned that the Steering Committee held a vote of no confidence today, 30 September 2025.

> Vote of no confidence of the entire SC 2025-09-30 (failed 3/6)
> * Ericson2314: -1
> * Gabriella439: +1
> * jtojnar: +1
> * roberth: -1
> * tomberek: -1
> * winterqt: +1

A "yes" vote to a vote of no confidence implies that the individual does not have trust in the SC. A "no" vote implies that there is still some trust left.

Why did you vote the way that you did?

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/452#issuecomment-3380111631">link</a>)</summary>

Well....... this is an easy copy-pasta! https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/25

---------------------------------------------------

A statement of why I oppose a full re-election:

I said most of this [a month ago](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971/58).

I was optimistic at that time. I am still trying to be optimistic. This is another variant of the same problem. We have seen any group of leaders we have become targeted and pressured until the stress breaks them. Look at the previous Board. Look through the history. From Eelco to Domen, Jonas, and Theophane. The SC just went through the same kind of targeting. Each person is put under pressure, receives open-letters, or campaigns of harassment, or undermined and then gaslit about it. The only escape is to resign or acquiesce. Then the attention goes to the next target. Are we to believe that they all were so flawed as to deserve all that pressure? The moderation teams have also had immense churn. Usually they didn’t have such targeted attacks hosted and amplified on official platforms (because those got moderated, thankfully), but they have had to deal with all the toxicity, which leads towards a large amount of stress, mental pressure, burnout, and finally frustration to give up.

For the recent attack on John; are we to believe that in the space of less than an hour or two and with incomplete information people are coming to reasonable judgements? Attaching names to a doc is a commitment strategy that discourages further review. Swept up by the whirlwind and passions, the mob is stirred up and then we are driven by fear yet again. And then the mob uses the chaos that it itself just caused, to decry the legitimacy of its target?

No. This is unjust. This is wrong. This leads to the very same outcome and history will repeat itself. Because there is no set of perfect leaders without flaws. The crowd has burned out many of the good ones; even the ones who could find ways to productively disagree, but who could work together on the one thing we should be here for. Again, I do not blame anyone who is calling for this. It is almost assuredly not malicious. But it is misguided and misled.

I know I have some minority opinions, but I am willing to concede quite a bit and compromise. I’ve abided by all decisions we made as an SC. That is how representative democracy works, it is the structure the NCA set up. It is the “hold outs” that have not gone back on their word or broken trust. The semi-yearly outrage behavior is shameful and having the targets of it simply walk away to offer the crowd a victory only encourages this to happen again the next time; it becomes normalized. A full reset and ongoing electioneering and manipulation means we end up with another set of 7 people, representative of the various groups, who distrust one another and will need to spend months to build it back up, but now they have even more pressure on them. By having SC continuity you at least have some stability over the long-term.

I will not reward such behavior, no matter who it is targeted at or what the motive is. The behavior is wrong, no matter the intention.

I am willing to discuss this with anyone and answer questions or discuss. Several of you have reached out, thank you.

Whereas the existing Nix projects have licenses already, one popular adage states technology is not neutral - perhaps increasingly obviously so, as the impact of technology continues to grow.

As such, zooming out a bit, one of the topics the community has seen different takes on seems whether we should govern by certain values, as exemplified by actions such as the earlier open letter against MIC sponsorships, a sentiment that seemed represented among contributors, or 'keep politics out', a sentiment that has seemed represented more at e.g. the NixOS sub-reddit.

Related to #470.

It has been brought to my attention that several candidates are interested in forming electoral coalitions[^1] where candidates agree to vote for each other in time for the election. This could significantly change the result of the election, especially if coalitions decide to formalize which candidates they choose to vote for and which they do not, and if many members of the same coalition are elected to office, their shared interests could dominate the SC. In spite of this, there are currently no rules in place that will require electoral coalition/alliance status to be disclosed in each candidate's statement. 

Do you think participation in coalitions and alliances *has to be* disclosed? If not, do you think they *should* be disclosed?

<summary>What are your thoughts on documentation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/339">link</a>)</summary>

Documentation is often cited as being lackluster, incomplete, or confusing. Personally, I disagree; I've seen many improvements to documentation over the years, and I think it has come a long way. Still, those improvements don't address the core issue for why documentation *feels* lackluster.

IMO, the issue is because the boundaries between projects are not clear. A new NixOS user will look at the NixOS manual for help: but really, they are using Nix+Nixpkgs+NixOS stack. For a beginner, it is not clear why there would be three manuals, and where the boundaries lie, and which manual they need (especially when interacting with a layering violation). This provides a frustrating experience, where despite the information being abundant, it is not at all discoverable in a relevant fashion.

Is this something that you are concerned with? What do you want to do with it? Direct more resources into cross-cutting documentation projects, like nix.dev or wiki.nixos.org ? Work on clearer project boundaries? Attempt to bridge documentation?

I am curious to hear your thoughts.

<summary>What is your view on licensing? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/338">link</a>)</summary>

Right now, the ecosystem is very split between permissive licenses (MIT), copyleft-ish licenses (LGLP, MPL), and copyleft licenses (GPL). This signifies a wider disagreement between people on what community is, and what to expect.

Licenses are by no means perfect, but they signify intention and direction. They are like a COC: adopting one doesn't instantly solve all of your problems (nor is expected to), but it shows where the project is heading. This has a lot of consequences later down the line. It could be argued that Nixpkgs being MIT-licensed is a reason why there are so many companies hanging around it; it could likewise be argued that the reason DetSys hasn't been more successful with their "downstream distribution" has to do with LGPL.

What is your view on licensing? Are you planning to put out guidelines for licensing official and community projects? Pursue relicensing various projects?

To me, SC results were disappointing. Despite the community having clearly cast their votes, not much of substance was achieved in a year. This is indicative of a "committee" situation: where consensus is required to make any decisions. This poses an existential threat to the effectiveness of SC, as SC is meant to represent very diverse parts of the community, that often have conflicting interests. Achieving consensus in such a case is a pipe dream.

That's why SC members need a lot more autonomy, to be able to make decisions on their own (overriden by majority, if significant opposition arises) and not get blocked by achieving impossible consensus. This is the entire purpose of SC, as consensus-driven decisions were made with RFCs, and ran into all the same issues.

Considering this, how would you reform the SC to allow for more individual action and autonomy?

<summary>What is a "competing implementation", and should being involved in one constitute a conflict of interest? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/456">link</a>)</summary>

(This is a little targeted, though everyone is welcome to chime in with their thoughts, of course.)

In https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3354754312 you said that you're worried about the current definition of "conflict of interest" not including "being involved in competing implementations and communities, social media groups, country, military status, and so forth".

What is a "competing implementation" or "competing community" to you? What level of involvement would you consider significant enough to constitute CoI? What decisions are you expecting the SC to make where this CoI becomes an issue?

Also, once again, as a litmus test, would any of these people be considered to have a CoI?
- a Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc team member
- a Determinate Systems employee
- a Snix/Tvix/Lix/etc contributor
- a contibutor to both NixOS/nix and Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc
- a person present in Tvix/Snix/Lix/etc discussion spaces
- an Auxolotl/Ekala/etc contributor
- a contributor to both NixOS/nixpkgs and Ekala/Auxolotl/etc
- a person present in Auxolotl/Ekala/etc discussion spaces

Also, can you maybe name examples of social media groups or countries that would be considered to have a CoI, and why/when?

<summary>If you are re-elected, how did you vote on previous issues? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/282">link</a>)</summary>

In a similar vein to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/256, opinions on past incidents present an important benchmark to judge candidate's moral and practical compass. This is even more important for existing SC members. SC has some out as a single front to make coordinated statements; I believe that to be an important mistake, that allows SC members to hide behind a bureaucratic body and avoid any kind of accountability. I believe it to be highly unfair. For that reason, I would like to know the historical votes of SC members on various issues.
