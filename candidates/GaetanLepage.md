### Conflict of interest disclosure

All my open source contributions to nix projects are made in my free time.
I have never been paid for my work in this area (and I have no current employment in general).

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

#### What I have done

- Started using Nix and NixOS in 2021
- Core maintainer of the [Nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim) project
- Regular contributor to **nixpkgs**:
    - [1000 PRs merged](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3AGaetanLepage), [1000 PRs reviewed](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=is%3Apr+reviewed-by%3AGaetanLepage+-author%3AGaetanLepage), [475 PRs otherwise commented](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=is%3Apr+commenter%3AGaetanLepage+-reviewed-by%3AGaetanLepage+-author%3AGaetanLepage), [464 PRs otherwise involved](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=is%3Apr+involves%3AGaetanLepage+-commenter%3AGaetanLepage+-reviewed-by%3AGaetanLepage+-author%3AGaetanLepage)
    - Member of the **Neovim team** (maintenance of the `neovim` package as well as the plugin ecosystem)
    - Member of the [CUDA team](https://nixos.org/community/teams/cuda/)
    - Regular maintainer of the (scientific) Python ecosystem (PyTorch, Jax, Tensorflow, ...)
- I was invited on the Full Time Nix podcast earlier this year: [link](https://fulltimenix.com/episodes/contributing-to-nixpkgs-nixvim-with-gaetan-lepage)

#### What I will do

My main motivation for running for the SC is to push Nix's adoption forward.
I believe that the role of the SC should be to unblock technical teams and let them push their respective areas forward.
However, some meta decisions need to be taken and the SC must tackle them.
It should also take responsibility for those decisions, embracing its role of governance body.

##### Scaling nixpkgs

nixpkgs is surely one of the most impressive achievements of the Nix project.
Its scale and freshness are unmatched.
Several positive changes have happened recently (formatting, GitHub-actions CI, Hydra queue-runner rewrite, etc.).
This type of meta-contribution reduces the friction for contributors and make them happier and more productive.
I want to encourage these endeavors.
Also, [the introduction of the nixpkgs core team](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/establishing-the-nixpkgs-core-team/69743) is a step in the right direction.
However, there are many more pain points that need to be addressed.
For instance, a contributor/reviewer/committer should be able to answer the question _"Is this PR ready to be merged"_ much faster.
More automation can make this process faster and less cumbersome.

##### Role of companies

When it comes to sponsorships, I think that we should welcome and encourage companies that want to help the community to thrive.
The recent success of NixCon 2025 was of course mostly guaranteed by the amazing organizing team, but would not have been possible without the financial help from its sponsors.
Besides the conference sponsorships, companies have significantly contributed by paying contributors to solve hard challenges and by providing compute infrastructure.
I want to encourage this pattern and push it further.
For this to be a success, the Nix community has to appear as a more mature community who focuses on solving hard technical challenges.
The endless stream of drama too often makes us look like kids arguing over unrelated matters.
Also, as this is controversial to some, I will mention that I have absolutely no issues with military companies participating in making Nix better.

##### Politics

No matter your opinion on the discussed topics, you should acknowledge that this community has seen an enormous amount of drama in recent years.
This disappoints me as it hinders the success of the project and brings negativity to an occupation which is a hobby for most of us.
One very positive thing this proves is that all of us deeply care for the project, otherwise we would not put so much energy into these fights.
However, we should deal with this and aim to spend more time coding than arguing on Discourse.
In my view, Nix is a software, technical project that a large and diverse group of people are working on.
Without any doubt, we will **never** manage to all agree on societal or political stances.
The good thing is that we **do not have to**.
We should all agree that the Nix project must be a space where people gather to work on software together and nothing more.
As long as people are engaging respectfully with each other, they should be welcomed, no matter who they are and what opinions they might express outside of the project.
This is also why I think that the official bodies of the project should not engage in political or social promotion activities.
