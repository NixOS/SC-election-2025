### Conflict of interest disclosure

None. Other than a bounty that I earned helping someone on the NixOS
Discourse with a derivation once (value approximately 100 €, IIRC), I have
never been paid for any work related to Nix, nor do I work for an employer
with a presence in the Nix community.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I love this project and I want to see it thrive. I am not concerned with
pushing the community in a direction such as ‘increasing adoption’. What I
mean by ‘thrive’ is that I want to see the energy of everyone in this
community put to its best use. Among other implications of that desire is
the notion that the superheroes of the community would be more productive
if they have someone who isn't as essential as they are in their current
positions doing the boring work to keep distractions off of their desks.
I'm ready to serve, if chosen.

#### What I have done

* Made small contributions to Nixpkgs, Nix, documentation, and
nixpkgs-update, from 2017 to the present. I'm a Nixpkgs committer and a
maintainer of a handful of packages.

* Most days, I put some time into trying to field beginner questions in
Discourse, and I use those experiences to feed into my small
contributions above.

* Served a brief (~4 months) tour on the moderation team in 2024. Before,
during, and after, generally tried to have a calming effect on
troublesome threads, or at least leave each one with a little bit better
chance for fact-based discussion and mutual understanding than I found
it. Mixed success.

* Lived for enough years to have developed a middle-aged person's sense of
time and patience, and an appreciation for the benefits of having a
variety of different ways of looking at the world at one's disposal.

#### What I will do

My abstract, metaphorical objective is to be a skeleton for the Nix
community. Without a skeleton, we are a quivering mass of brain and
muscle. To provide a structure for all that meat, an effective skeleton
must have flexible joints to allow freedom of motion, and rigid bones to
provide leverage and make the tension between opposing muscles productive.
I have little desire to tell the project where to aim; that's a brain job.
But by providing a reliable structure that bends where and when it needs
to, I hope to help transmute conflict and confusion into cooperation.

Less abstractly, here's what I'll do:

* Not assume I have the best answer to most questions. There are a lot of
smart people in this community, and ignoring their expertise is one of
the dumbest things I could do. When deferring to an existing team is a
reasonable option, it's the option I'll favor. When it isn't, either
because the existing team is obviously floundering or because there
isn't one, for non-urgent questions I will aim to ‘assemble a panel of
advisors’ (i.e., shoot off some PMs) to figure out the best thing to do,
and trust them. For questions where any answer is likely to be better
than a delay, I will try to ensure that a quick answer is chosen within
a structure that ensures that mistakes can be quickly identified and
corrected with minimal community cost. When establishing new teams fits
naturally into this process, I will push for that.

* Be personally communicative. This is a distinct goal from
‘transparency’, though it addresses many of the same problems. The goal
is to make sure you the community feel like you know what I'm doing, and
like you have the opportunity to reach out and make your voice heard
before we make big decisions. The specific implementation of that goal
is not fixed in my mind. We may publish meeting minutes. I might hold
regular office hours, or write a newsletter. I'm strongly in favor of
publishing votes, though that doesn't address the goal I mentioned (it
does serve accountability, though, which is also important). You get the
idea. Different implementations might work better for different
community members, and so I would want to pick an implementation for my
personal communications that is intentionally different from what other
SC members do, if they have similar goals. Everyone in the community
should feel comfortable talking to at least one SC representative on any
issue, and that involves considering not just with *whom* you feel
comfortable, but also *how* you feel comfortable communicating.

* Push for legible processes and policies. Legibility is an accessibility
issue. Being explicit rather than implicit makes it easier for people
from different cultures to all work together. It is also a boon for
people whose minds are structured to absorb implicit community norms
less readily. I don't mean to say that every process and policy should
be expressible at the level of program code; that would be an
undesirable extreme, as it leads to ossification, rules lawyering, and
depersonalization. But being comfortable and effective in socially
ambiguous contexts is a privilege, and we owe it to our community to
accommodate those without that privilege by documenting what we can,
when we can — and also it's cool when, sometimes, that *can* be code. (I
look forward to many spirited discussions with @philiptaron on this, if
one or both of us are selected!)

* Avoid shaking the bowl. The last few years has felt like, if you'll
indulge one more metaphor, walking down a winding hallway with an
over-full bowl of water. Each time we've turned a corner, some water has
spilled out (some people have left us). The bowl is still very full! But
losing any water is sad, and if we double-back on corners we've already
turned, we'll pay their cost in water twice. So I will aim, where
applicable, to keep us on a pre-existing trajectory when the alternative
is to cause people who have made peace with how things had been going to
decide that they need to leave now. (This doesn't mean ‘avoid solving
problems we've avoided solving in the past’! We have to move forward,
and if that means turning a corner and sloshing, we're going to slosh.
I only want to avoid paying out of both sides of the bowl for the same
corner.)


I am happy to share my opinions. You can always reach out to me by e-mail
or on Discourse and I will probably write too many words on most subjects.
But don't vote for me for my opinions. Many of them need changing, and the
struggle is knowing which ones. Vote for me if you like the way I think,
make decisions, and treat others, because none of that is changing.
