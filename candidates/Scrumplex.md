### Conflict of interest disclosure

All my contributions were done by me in my free time. I do not get
paid
for open source work. My employer does not promote the use of Nix
(yet), though my team and I do use Nix in a limited capacity. I am
working at Deutsche Telekom IT GmbH, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom
AG.

### Motivation

I want Nix to succeed. It powers all my devices, and I use it where I
can. This requires a healthy community and I believe I can help shape
the SC decisions to achieve this.

### What I have done

- Former maintainer and community manager of Prism Launcher, a FOSS
Minecraft launcher [2024-sc-election]
-Â Active Nixpkgs committer

### What Ill do

- Implement a Nix Ecosystem Incubation program akin to CNCFs
incubation program
- Currently, the Nix ecosystem is quite scattered. While there is 
nix-community that serves as an inofficial incubator, there is no 
clear process for promoting these into Nixpkgs/NixOS
- Implement a mentorship system to help regular contributors become
maintainers
