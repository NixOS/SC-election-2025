### Conflict of interest disclosure

List any potential conflicts of interest ([what is
that?](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/blob/main/doc/conflict-of-interest.md))

- I work sporadically with Numtide, most of my technical contributions I do on my free time. My academic contributions are funded by the [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/).
  
### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I care deeply about the Nix project: it has shaped a significant part of both my professional and personal life. However, I am deeply concerned by the long-standing conflicts within our community and the shift in values that prompted the departure of many highly respected contributors. These challenges are a barrier to the project’s success and to the participation of many talented individuals who could help Nix thrive.
The introduction of the Steering Committee was an important step towards healthier governance and conflict resolution, but the work is far from finished. We are now at a critical point in the project’s life: if the next Steering Committee cannot regain trust and foster a sense of unity, we risk remaining in a state of crisis for the long term.

I am running for the Steering Committee because I want to help build a governance structure that is trusted, effective, and inclusive — one that enables us to resolve conflicts constructively and keep our focus on the shared vision that brought us together.

*My application is not fueled by personal ambition, but by the urgency of this moment. I believe the Steering Committee must actively steer the community towards trust and constructive governance, and I am committed to helping ensure that happens.*

I have written [a comprehensive blog post](https://luj.fr/blog/my-hopes-and-plans-for-nixos.html) summarizing the state of mind behind my application and my platform, and I encourage voters who want to better understand where I stand to read it.

#### What I have done

I have contributed to the NixOS community these past 4 years in diverse areas:

- I am a NixOS contributor and committer, most of my work has to do with the NixOS boot process. I have also participated in the NixOS infra team and I am the author of [Proxmox-NixOS](https://github.com/SaumonNet/proxmox-nixos);
- I have organized numerous community events like NixCon 2022, FOSDEM devroom 2023 and 2024, and the Parisian NixOS meetup;
- As part of my PhD, I have contributed [several peer-reviewed academic papers related to NixOS](https://luj.fr/research.html).

#### What I will do (details in my [blog post](https://luj.fr/blog/my-hopes-and-plans-for-nixos.html))

##### Strengthen and sustain NixOS governance

- Learn from the lessons of the first year of the Steering Committee and feedback from members (see [this retrospective by Gabriella](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html) for example) to adapt and strengthen our governance model;
- Adopt a policy of very transparent communication (meeting minutes, votes) and include it in the constitution;
- Commit to publishing personal reports if official communication remains insufficient.

##### Foster an inclusive and welcoming community

- Push for transparent, fair processes to access positions of responsibility (commit rights, team membership, etc.);
- Listen to and amplify the voices of those most affected by bias or discrimination when shaping policies.

##### Protect the Nix brand from harmful associations

- Support a Sponsorship Policy that prevents endorsement of unethical actors.
- Work towards a Nix trademark and policy for responsible brand use, following models from other OSS projects.
