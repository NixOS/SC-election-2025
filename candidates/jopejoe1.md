### What i will do

Increase the collaboration between the teams and the steering committee
by gathering feedback from teams and talking with them before making a
decision.

To further make sure that teams feel that they are getting heard, I want
to make the meeting notes of the SC visible to the public and also make
it so that relevant teams can sit in on meetings of the SC to give
advice and feedback to the SC members.

Furthermore, I would like to move most of the regular treewide
improvements into CI checks to reduce the amount these treewides need to
be re-run. I also want to increase what we check in CI so that we don't
have as much code that does not get tested in nixpkgs.
