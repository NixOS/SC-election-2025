## Conflict of interest disclosure

I work for CalmWave, a US healthcare startup. We have no Nix-related financial ties, but we do use Nix and NixOS extensively.

## Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I want Nix to be a popular and widely used technology, as it's a revolutionary technology that eliminates entire classes of problems that technical teams struggle with.

### What I have done

I am a Nixpkgs committer and maintainer. My noteworthy contributions include Incus support in NixOS, which involves everything from container/VM images to extensive integration tests, and more recently building upon the BEAM ecosystem foundation to ensure Nix is a great platform for developers wanting to use the BEAM.

Professionally I've been a sysadmin, a devops engineer, a developer, an engineering manager and a University professor.

### What I will do

I believe that democratic systems require transparency, or they risk being undemocratic. If elected I will immediately advocate for increased community insight into the workings of the SC. This could include public vote counts and possibly even recording or holding public meetings.

I will work towards continued delegation of decision making and responsibility to official teams. The SC by design should be empowering other teams throughout the community as those teams are better positioned to make decisions closer to the problems. At the same time, I think it's important that we create processes for escalation and conflict resolution that honor the democratic process. I'm also interested in understanding what teams we're missing and how we can fill them.

I will investigate ways we can increase democratic participation, particularly for the most vested individuals in our community. The SC is accountable to the community through elections, but I feel the community should have a voice in important decisions.

Finally, I will be an engaged member of the process who wants to build consensus, but also understands that consensus is not always possible. In those cases, I think it's more important to avoid deadlock and make the best decisions a majority of the group can agree on.
