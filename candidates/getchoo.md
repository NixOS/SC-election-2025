### Conflict of interest disclosure

I currently work as a cashier, with no relation to Nix in my work.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

Over the past 3 years, Nix and its community have become a large part of my daily life. Whether it be from using the work of others or submitting my own, the technology, and the people who create it are a key part in how I develop and use software. I strongly believe the Steering Committee is key in improving the experiences of and around these projects, as well as creating an environment that better respects the very people that made all the experiences I've loved possible.

As the last year has shown though, this experiment still has a way to go. My hope here is that I can help make this governance more sustainable, transparent, and representative of its community.

#### What I will do

My plans can be summarized into three key points:

##### Increasing transparency

**Members of the Steering Committee should be held publicly responsible for their votes**, and the community should be aware of when and what topics are under consideration.

As a way of promoting this, I am in support of regular, publicly scheduled meetings of the Steering Committee. Minutes should be recorded for each of these meetings, documenting the topics of discussion, as well as the attendance, points made, and votes cast by each member. These minutes should then be published shortly after each meeting is held for community comment.

I am also in favor of having "Observers" for the Steering Committee - allowing neutral third parties access to these meetings and other communications between the Steering Committee in order to report back to the community.

##### Empowering the community

**A goal of the Steering Committee should be to uplift and directly respond to the feedback of those in the project.**

I believe the Steering Committee should not be involved in most day-to-day decisions, and should instead delegate most of their power to smaller, more focused teams. The only time the Steering Committee should usually step in is when discussions break down, decisions cannot be made, and/or the topic affects multiple areas of the project.

Specifically, as a Steering Committee member, I would push for giving more resources and autonomy to existing groups such as the Documentation Team, Wiki Team, Moderation Team, and the newly created Nixpkgs Core Team. This would include things like organizational help, infrastructure assistance, facilitating collaboration between different teams, or just keeping an ear open for - and properly responding to - feedback.

##### Creating long-term solutions through institutional changes

**Making these changes now is not enough**. Some fundamental changes to our systems must be made to avoid our current problems, and make it easier to solve future ones.

I strongly believe that the measures taken for the goals described above should not just be implemented based on the good faith of the upcoming Steering Committee, but as a *binding requirement* for all future terms, barring a constitutional amendment. Open and honest transparency, the ability to hold Steering Committee members responsible for their actions in office, delegation of Steering Committee power, autonomy of teams, and community support should be cornerstones for how we operate into the future.

I also believe in exploring more tools to give voters in directly making changes, regardless of the current Steering Committee. Namely, I'd like to allow for [voter-led initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_initiative) on constitutional amendments, as well as the ability of voters to trigger [recall elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election) or a Vote of No Confidence. This would help avoid any potential conflicts of interest members of the Steering Committee may have in limiting or even removing their own power, as well as give voters more opportunity to make change outside of the regular election season.
