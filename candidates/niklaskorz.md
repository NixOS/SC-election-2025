tool suite from Germany, uses Nix for CI/CD and some internal
applications)

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

Over the past three years, Nix and NixOS have become an irreplaceable
part of my personal machine setups and my development workflows. They
have fundamentally changed how I think about building and shipping
software and how I operate servers. To enable people to work on the
pillars of NixOS and Nix with as little hurdles as possible, we need a
stable, decisive NixOS Foundation. That is a cause to which I would
happily contribute my time and resources.

I've been the administrator of a regional Mastodon instance for three
and a half years now, that I successfully transferred into community
governance of a regional non-profit association in 2024. I still partake
in the moderation and administrative decisions of it, but with 3500 users,
700 of which have still been active in 2025, I quickly realised that I cannot
make decisions for such a large user base completely on my own. It might not
be as large or fragmented as the NixOS community, due to the nature of the
Fediverse, but so far we manage to work and come to decisions fine in our
moderation group of seven people.

I also have prior experience with the organisational distress of chasing
after people, having been the organiser of the local Mannheim/Heidelberg
NixOS and Rust meetups for close to two years now.

#### What I have done

- For close to two years now, I am organising the local NixOS meetup for
the German Rhine-Neckar region in Mannheim and Heidelberg to help people
in our community connect, exchange ideas and learn.
- As a more recent member of the nixpkgs committer team (as of April
2025), I'm trying to help new-ish contributors with their onboarding
into our world by offering them the possibility of a direct exchange,
whenever I feel that the traditional PR feedback loop may become too
frustrating for them.

#### What I will do

- Increase SC transparency by advocating for public logs of SC meetings
as long as they do not contain confidential information, as well as
installing SC board observers that can vouch for their correctness.
- Support the new nixpkgs core team in pushing forward reforms in the
commit bit delegation process, at the very least by giving them full
power in doing so.
- Encourage stronger exchange between our upstream Nix implementation
and the different FOSS Nix implementations that have become an integral
part of our community. I am of the firm believe that their existence is
a net positive for our ecosystem and that our upstream implementation
can only benefit from their input.
- Investigate how the SC can encourage diversity in foundation-financed
events such as NixCon or sprints. The demographics at these events are
not representative of the many people I got to know and become friends
with in this community.
