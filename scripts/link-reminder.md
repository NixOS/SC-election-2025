Dear @GITHUBUSERNAME@,

You are receiving this email because you are an automatically eligible voter (see links below for details) who has not yet set a voting email address.

Voting in the second Steering Committee election starts on 2025-10-15.

:warning: In this election, we ask all eligible voters to explicitly choose an email address with which they will vote. This avoids misuse of emails collected for other purposes.
