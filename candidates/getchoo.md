### Conflict of interest disclosure

I currently work as a cashier, with no relation to Nix in my work.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

Over the past 3 years, Nix and its community have become a large part of my daily life. Whether it be from using the work of others or submitting my own, the technology, and the people who create it are a key part in how I develop and use software. I strongly believe the Steering Committee is key in improving the experiences of and around these projects, as well as creating an environment that better respects the very people that made all the experiences I've loved possible.

As the last year has shown though, this experiment still has a way to go. My hope here is that I can help make this governance more sustainable, transparent, and representative of its community.

#### What I will do

My plans can be summarized into three key points:

##### Increasing transparency

**Members of the Steering Committee should be held publicly responsible for their votes**, and the community should be aware of when and what topics are under consideration.

As a way of promoting this, I am in support of regular, publicly scheduled meetings of the Steering Committee. Minutes should be recorded for each of these meetings, documenting the topics of discussion, as well as the attendance, points made, and votes cast by each member. These minutes should then be published shortly after each meeting is held for community comment.

I am also in favor of having "Observers" for the Steering Committee - allowing neutral third parties access to these meetings and other communications between the Steering Committee in order to report back to the community.

##### Empowering the community

**A goal of the Steering Committee should be to uplift and directly respond to the feedback of those in the project.**

I believe the Steering Committee should not be involved in most day-to-day decisions, and should instead delegate most of their power to smaller, more focused teams. The only time the Steering Committee should usually step in is when discussions break down, decisions cannot be made, and/or the topic affects multiple areas of the project.

Specifically, as a Steering Committee member, I would push for giving more resources and autonomy to existing groups such as the Documentation Team, Wiki Team, Moderation Team, and the newly created Nixpkgs Core Team. This would include things like organizational help, infrastructure assistance, facilitating collaboration between different teams, or just keeping an ear open for - and properly responding to - feedback.

##### Creating long-term solutions through institutional changes

**Making these changes now is not enough**. Some fundamental changes to our systems must be made to avoid our current problems, and make it easier to solve future ones.

I strongly believe that the measures taken for the goals described above should not just be implemented based on the good faith of the upcoming Steering Committee, but as a *binding requirement* for all future terms, barring a constitutional amendment. Open and honest transparency, the ability to hold Steering Committee members responsible for their actions in office, delegation of Steering Committee power, autonomy of teams, and community support should be cornerstones for how we operate into the future.

I also believe in exploring more tools to give voters in directly making changes, regardless of the current Steering Committee. Namely, I'd like to allow for [voter-led initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_initiative) on constitutional amendments, as well as the ability of voters to trigger [recall elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election) or a Vote of No Confidence. This would help avoid any potential conflicts of interest members of the Steering Committee may have in limiting or even removing their own power, as well as give voters more opportunity to make change outside of the regular election season.


## Q&A

### Should the SC vote for confidence instead of for no-confidence? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472))


The [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#full-reelections) reads:

> A simple majority within the SC may call a reelection of the entire SC based on perceived loss of confidence.

This can lead to a 3-3 deadlock as we [currently](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) [see](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/6). In this deadlock, neither the reelection, nor any majority vote can pass - the SC is unable to function.

**In many legislatures, this is flipped into a vote of confidence that must pass to avoid a re-election.** This would have the same results for a full SC, but avoid situations like the current 3-3 deadlock.

Do you support amending the constitution accordingly?

### How would you handle an SC member joining Anduril? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190))


Recently, current SC member Tom Bereknyei took a new job at Anduril. After parts of the community [criticized](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971) the SC for not communicating this publicly, the SC gave a [statement](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/statement-on-a-steering-committee-member-joining-anduril/69007).

As an SC member, how would you like the SC to handle such a situation in the future?

*Please focus on the community aspects and be specific in what actions should be taken in such a scenario. This is not the place to discuss your opinion about the [MIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex).*

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190#issuecomment-3396365808">link</a>)</summary>

Organizationally, I would push for an amendment requiring members of the SC to regularly update their Conflict of Interest statements throughout their time in office when necessary, and on (reasonable) request. While I do *somewhat* agree with the SC statement that this wouldn't of quelled all controversy, I believe the way this news was dropped was a big shock to many (myself included) and did not at all inspire more trust in members of office; in contrast, properly disclosing this would've helped likely helped more people give members some benefit of the doubt, and is frankly just what the community deserves

Personally, I would speak out about the update, as well as any drastic changes or conflicts in decision-making I may notice from the member as time goes on

### Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265))


In https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html, current SC member Gabriella argues that 7 members are too many for the SC to operate efficiently and effectively.

With the experience we made after one year: Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members?

I seem to have had the same reaction as @JulienMalka here:

> I don't think answering this question without having a first-hand experience of the dynamics inside the Steering Committee makes a lot of sense.

I'm not at all opposed to this possibility, but I think it's important to get more insight into how the SC currently functions and *could* function with a different set of members before having much of a stance on this

### Community participant behaviour regarding moderation decisions ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/477))


**Scenario**: While being suspended by a decision from the moderation team, a suspended community participant mass mails other community participants about a community matter. The recipients did not all have an existing relationship, or a good-standing relationship with the suspended individual.

**Question**: What do you think of this behaviour? How do you characterize this in regard of the expected conduct, and the values of this community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/477#issuecomment-3396290716">link</a>)</summary>

I'd definitely find it odd

Community members are free to do what they please outside of our official spaces of course - and in isolation, I'm not sure of much action to be taken against this, aside from just finding it odd. **However**, I do think it would be important to consider this kind of behavior in the same context as the participants actions *in* official spaces (as at this scale, it's affecting a wide number of people; part of the community), as well as the moderation decisions in response to those actions

### How transparent should the SC be? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407))


In a [blog post](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html), resigned SC member @Gabriella439 recommended future SCs to increase transparency toward the community. (A different recommendation there, regarding SC size, is the subject of #265.)

In particular, the argument for this went (non-header emphasis mine):

> **Poor self-organization and internal policies/procedures**

[...]

> I think one of the big mistakes we made was that we insisted on **“speaking with one voice”**, meaning that we could not make any meaningful external statements or comments without getting majority approval from the committee (something we had difficulty with on the regular). This is why the committee remained largely silent or slow-to-respond on a large number of issues.

> This problem got bad enough that at some point many members began to break the wall of silence by commenting in an unofficial capacity on high-profile issues so that outsiders would get some visibility into what was going on instead of waiting for us to completely the slow process of gathering enough consensus and votes.

> Another internal policy that I believe was counter-productive was **not disclosing the final votes** on various issues or requiring individual signatories on public statements. Had we done this it would have likely broken a lot of internal stalemates and filibusters if all committee members were held publicly accountable for their policy positions (and therefore subject to public pressure).

> It would have also helped with another issue, which was:

> **Absenteeism**

> For various reasons (some justifiable, some not), at many points in time a large number of committee members would be unreachable, even during crucial junctures like ongoing controversy. This absenteeism was masked by the committee not publicizing that fact earlier. **If we had required all votes to be publicly recorded and all statements to require individual signatories** it would have exposed this absenteeism earlier (and led to quicker corrections).

As such, I would like to ask SC candidates: how do you regard the topic of SC transparency in light of @Gabriella439's recommendations, if not more generally? Further, how would you concretely enact these views in the SC, if elected?

> how do you regard the topic of SC transparency in light of @Gabriella439's recommendations, if not more generally?

I believe it is key in keeping faith in the SC

As someone on the outside...I honestly haven't really known what the SC was ever actively considering or doing at any given time. That's a problem.

And even when I *did* know when a decision was being made, I wasn't sure how it was, why it was, or by whom. It makes it quite frustrating, especially when I know my votes this election would've probably been very different if certain information hadn't been "leaked"

> Further, how would you concretely enact these views in the SC, if elected?

### If mods are cops, who should decide on punishments? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464))


Related to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428 and the ongoing discussion on discourse about the resignation of the moderation team: https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828

I’ve seen different metaphors for what moderators are supposed to be. Some say moderators are like cops (enforcing rules), others say they’re like paramedics (helping people in crisis).

But no one has made the case for moderators as _judges_. If moderators are indeed tasked with enforcing rules, who then plays the role of the judiciary in our governance model? Do you think mods alone should be able to decide on the punishment (especially lifetime bans)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464#issuecomment-3396331391">link</a>)</summary>

I don't really agree with mods being cops, but going along with the rest of the question:

> If moderators are indeed tasked with enforcing rules, who then plays the role of the judiciary in our governance model?

Generally, also moderators

Assuming your definition of judiciary is something along the lines of "the ones who interpret the law" (with the law being our COC, shared values, etc.), mods will usually be the ones coming to the conclusion of whether or not someone's behavior is in violation of that "law". I think that's a reasonable part of the job

> Do you think mods alone should be able to decide on the punishment (especially lifetime bans)?

*Only* mods, no. In extreme cases, lifetime bans should be able to be reversed and possibly escalated to something like the SC

But generally, yes. As long as there is transparency in the process, we should be trusting our moderation team to moderate

### Should community-related Conflicts of Interest be considered for the SC election? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192))


The [constitution explicitly mentions](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#conflict-of-interest-coi-balance) "employees of the same company or otherwise the same payer for Nix work" as *examples* of Conflicts of Interest for the constitution of the SC.

In the current SC, we had three members of the Nix team (Ericson2314, roberth, tomberek) and two members of the commit bit delegation team (jtojnar, winterqt), which arguably reduces diversity as well.

Should team-memberships in the community also be considered as Conflicts of Interest for the SC election? Why (not)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3396381600">link</a>)</summary>

In general, no

I think @rhendric made a good point on members of the SC recusing themselves in decisions affecting their team, but other than that I don't personally see much issue with it - especially if the SC properly delegated more authority to teams rather than themselves

### How would you act on the moderation team's call to SC candidates? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/390))

### What should happen in the event of an SC member resigning early? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481))


The SC is currently elected by proportional representation, which seeks to reflect the preferences of its voters.
However, over this initial SC term we have seen multiple early resignations, potentially making what remains of the SC less representative of its voter base, if not also affecting [decision-making capabilities](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/some-procedural-clarifications-on-the-constitution/70278).

Now, there may be alternate ways to deal with scenarios involving early retirement, including going over the original votes to recalculate what alternate candidate might best represent this part of the electorate, or (eventually) even calling new elections.

As a candidate to the body in charge of our constitution, how would you ideally see these cases handled?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481#issuecomment-3396694100">link</a>)</summary>

</details>

### How should the SC communicate with the community? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199))


The [list of official announcements](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/announcements/steering-committee/57) from the first year of SC starts with two general updates in November and December 24, then continues with only specific announcement on certain topics. Even if a bit delayed, the Foundation has given [more updates](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/meta/nixos-foundation/47).

Arguably there was not much insight for the community into what the SC was working on.

How would an SC with you as a member, communicate with the community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199#issuecomment-3396516989">link</a>)</summary>

I am in support of public minutes for regularly scheduled meetings, including topics of conversation, points made, and votes cast. These should one day be recorded by an "Observer"-like role: an independent, trusted member of the community who can hold the SC directly accountable

I would also like to introduce regular "town halls" where members of the community can ask the SC questions directly, as well as encourage members of the SC to provide more direct means of communication (i.e., e-mail, Matrix, Discord). I would personally use these latter two options as frequently as I could

My first priority would be creating a new moderation team that can sit alongside the (technical) SC and be more independent, well trusted, and transparent. In the course of doing that, I would also like to increase the transparency of the SC itself by publishing all vote counts, creating meeting minutes, and hosting town halls for community question

Once these things are picked up, I would like to focus on codifying them into our constitution. There should be clear amendments describing the relationship between our moderation team and SC, "checks" they have against each other, and clear, enforceable transparency requirements for each

After, I would explore further amendments that give more power to contributors and voters alike. I currently think this would be best done by giving voters clearer ways to take direct action, such as putting amendment propositions on the ballot and recalling members of office. Technical decisions of the SC should also be distributed down the chain to smaller team - like the newly created Nixpkgs Core Team

### Voter mechanisms to recall individual candidates ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482))


Over the past days, there have been [multiple](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971/) [calls](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/) for individual SC candidates to step down, or even calling for a [full reelection](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/).

Current procedures have yet to take into account such desires, meaning we would currently depend on either:

- SC members voting one another out (re: individual SC members)
- SC votes of no confidence (c.f. #472)

Would you rather see such a formal mechanism to retroactively retract/amend votes or recall individual delegates? If yes, what should this look like? If not, why not?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482#issuecomment-3396701563">link</a>)</summary>

I think voters should have the ability to petition for a member to be recalled. Once that petition grows to a specific number of eligible voters, a special election should then be held

I believe a similar system should also exist for voters calling for a Vote of No Confidence against the entire SC

### How do you want to proceed with sponsorship policy? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/342))


Last year, one of the most important questions to people running for SC was sponsorship policy, in particular regarding MIC companies. Since then, there were some efforts on the SC side to draft a comprehensive sponsorship policy, and they also started approving/denying sponsors directly, without delegation to NixCon team.

Do you feel like SC taking on this job is adequate in the long run, or do you see it as a temporary measure? What are your next steps on pursuing a sponsorship policy?

No. I would like to make a dedicated team around this for events, that takes into account existing community input on potential sponsors, as well as actively responds to feedback based on their considerations/decisions

We shouldn't need to repeat the Anduril situation each and every time a company the community doesn't approve of attempts to get involved. Instead, there should be procedures in place to evolve our policies to stay in-line with community sentiment

### How are you going to interact with Lix? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/283))


Lix is now a major part of the ecosystem, providing a non-commercial, production-ready alternative to Nix. It falls outside of governance power of SC, but coordination with it is of paramount importance for Nix development, security patching, and stability of Nixpkgs (as there have been numerous occasions where Lix has fixed a crucial bug that was preventing Nixpkgs work, while Nix hasn't). Historically, there has been hostility towards Lix and running it on NixOS Community infra.

How do you plan to structure your communication with Lix Project?

But generally, I think it would be good to always keep an open line with them in regards to things like security issues, ecosystem development, and any potential standardization efforts that might take place.

### How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197))

Some aspects of this, such as the "Nix the trademark" are likely things for the [foundation](https://github.com/nixos/foundation) to deal with.

However, Determinate Systems is *part of the community* as well, so this conflict also has aspects internal to the Nix community.

I'd like to coordinate with the (future) moderation team on what actions we should take on how they interact in our spaces, as well as how we interact with their code

Some questions I'd personally raise are how we should handle their promotions on places such as the Discourse, mentions of them and their products in documentation, and how projects like the [Foundation's fork of their installer](https://github.com/NixOS/experimental-nix-installer) and Nix itself should distance themselves from DetSys' products

### What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to community and Foundation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337))


(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/34 from 2024 election)

What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to the community? Should they be linked on the homepage? If so, should they be compelled to comply with the Foundation's code of conduct? Should we attempt to convert these communities into official spaces (if so, at what point)?

I think the status quo is in a decent spot, but could see some improvement. We should encourage and allow unofficial communities, but do some vetting in what exactly we link

> should they be compelled to comply with the Foundation's code of conduct?

I'm not sure if "compelled" is the word for what I believe. To be linked on nixos.org, they should generally fall in line with the CoC and [our stated values](https://github.com/NixOS/nix-constitutional-assembly/blob/00b53920442a5077fa8c295a9955042e45080323/values.md) -- specifically in basic respect and civility encouraged throughout the community, as well as putting people first. For those that don't, I'm not sure if it would be effective or worth our time to try and force it; the best thing to do in those cases IMO would be to not link to them

> Should we attempt to convert these communities into official spaces (if so, at what point)?

We should leave the door open if these communities wish to become official spaces, and ensure they meet the standards of our community before accepting them. Attempting to proactively convert them may be more of a disservice to those communities than anything, and create a lot of (pointless) conflict with those who don't share our values

### How are you going to resolve S3 cache situation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/336))


S3 cache size continues to rise. AWS still pays the bills for it, but this part of infra is something that might need a look.

Latest updates on the topic that I could find were from about a year ago on the Discourse:

https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-06-06-re-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-6/46617
https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-07-10-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-7/48821

My understanding is that it's a complicated topic, where a lot of technical decisions need to be made, and Foundation needs to get a lot of talks with various potential partners, and this needs to be coordinated. Binary cache is a center piece of the infra, so its future needs to be well-secured; do you have any concrete steps in mind on how to proceed? Maybe coordinating with someone doing software archiving?

### How can contributing to Nix-the-implementation be made easier? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196))


It has repeatedly been mentioned in the past, that contributing to [Nix](https://github.com/nixos/nix) is hard.

As someone who has been contributing to Nix recently, I don't think it's been all that bad of an experience as is! I've found the Nix team fairly communicative with their minutes, fast to respond to issues/PRs, and are more than willing to hold my hand a bit. I'd like to do my best to keep enabling that

But if I was giving suggestions, I think it would be interesting to take some notes from Lix - namely in their many DX improvements, modern async stuff with the `kj` runtime(?), refactors, new testing system, and release notes system. I've always found that stuff to be nicer there, and a lot more welcoming

### Should electoral alliances/coalitions count as conflicts of interest? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/479))


Related to #470.

It has been brought to my attention that several candidates are interested in forming electoral coalitions[^1] where candidates agree to vote for each other in time for the election. This could significantly change the result of the election, especially if coalitions decide to formalize which candidates they choose to vote for and which they do not, and if many members of the same coalition are elected to office, their shared interests could dominate the SC. In spite of this, there are currently no rules in place that will require electoral coalition/alliance status to be disclosed in each candidate's statement. 

Do you think participation in coalitions and alliances *has to be* disclosed? If not, do you think they *should* be disclosed?

[^1]: To be clear, *informal* alignments such as friendships do not count here — whether *those* should be counted as CoIs deserve a different issue altogether.

### How are you planning to pursue a trademark? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/340))


A trademark is direly needed, as there are many commercial projects who use "Nix" in their name for marketing purposes, sometimes confusingly. However, the trademark rules have to be reasonable for downstream users, and put clear guidelines. Furthermore, there might be conflicts if the trademark policy doesn't match a company's path. Additionally, it will require a clear set of guidelines between what each of Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS project constitutes, and how much "Nix" they share (possibly with renaming?)

How do you plan to handle this?

### If you were in a previous SC, how would you vote on public issues? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/281))


There were several decisions made by previous SC in response to community conflicts. They set an important benchmark to gauge candidate's decision-making. Those questions are:

    Allow Anduril to keep publishing jobs on Discourse?
    Replace PolyMC with Prism Launcher?
    What should be the policy on MIC participation?
    What should be the policy for telemetry?

What additional initiatives would you raise?

No

I would recuse myself from this. I work on Prism Launcher, and maintain it in Nixpkgs

But I think @K900 had a good response on this above

> What should be the policy on MIC participation?

I'd lean towards an outright ban on MIC sponsoring events - or at the very least, not being able to display, advertise, or otherwise get anything from said sponsorship

Past that it's longer conversation

I think I'd mostly agree with what the current SC concluded

### How do you want to structure communication with Determinate Systems? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/341))


The title might seem excessively direct. However, last year, there was a question on MIC policy and Anduril ban. Since then, SC has enforced a ban on Anduril job posting. Anduril has been a very controversial company for the wide community; I feel like it's fitting to ask about another controversial company, and how to interact with it.

What are the problems you see with communication between Determinate Systems and NixOS Community? Are there concrete suggestions you have, or would like to propose? What other areas of work (Nix improvements, trademark policy, etc.) do you feel prevent healthy collaboration?

### What are your thoughts on documentation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/339))


Documentation is often cited as being lackluster, incomplete, or confusing. Personally, I disagree; I've seen many improvements to documentation over the years, and I think it has come a long way. Still, those improvements don't address the core issue for why documentation *feels* lackluster.

IMO, the issue is because the boundaries between projects are not clear. A new NixOS user will look at the NixOS manual for help: but really, they are using Nix+Nixpkgs+NixOS stack. For a beginner, it is not clear why there would be three manuals, and where the boundaries lie, and which manual they need (especially when interacting with a layering violation). This provides a frustrating experience, where despite the information being abundant, it is not at all discoverable in a relevant fashion.

Is this something that you are concerned with? What do you want to do with it? Direct more resources into cross-cutting documentation projects, like nix.dev or wiki.nixos.org ? Work on clearer project boundaries? Attempt to bridge documentation?

I am curious to hear your thoughts.

I very much agree that this is the core issue

My main proposition for the "glue" between all of these manuals (and filling those layering violation gaps) is wiki.nixos.org. It seems natural to me as it already covers all topics, and is meant to provide snippet-y information while linking back to full sources (the manuals)

### What is your view on licensing? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/338))


Right now, the ecosystem is very split between permissive licenses (MIT), copyleft-ish licenses (LGLP, MPL), and copyleft licenses (GPL). This signifies a wider disagreement between people on what community is, and what to expect.

Licenses are by no means perfect, but they signify intention and direction. They are like a COC: adopting one doesn't instantly solve all of your problems (nor is expected to), but it shows where the project is heading. This has a lot of consequences later down the line. It could be argued that Nixpkgs being MIT-licensed is a reason why there are so many companies hanging around it; it could likewise be argued that the reason DetSys hasn't been more successful with their "downstream distribution" has to do with LGPL.

What is your view on licensing? Are you planning to put out guidelines for licensing official and community projects? Pursue relicensing various projects?

<summary>Stance on specific case of statements made by external actors (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/485">link</a>)</summary>

The following was authored by @jaen but I'm posting it on their behalf because they cannot and I would like answers to it as well. The title of the issue was written by me.

---

The recent SC turmoil had been commented on outside the community in various venues. In particular, I'd like to draw attention to this [Twitter thread](https://xcancel.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1972037286192992320) where certain individuals talk about _“get[ting] these nut jobs out”_ and that _“[M]aybe @<!-- -->PalmerLuckey can help turn the ship around.”_ While the Anduril founder does not acknowledge those proposals directly, he says this:

> The good news is that Anduril will keep using Nix to build ever more powerful weapons for American dominance regardless of what the fringe "community" people say.

The question is, what is your stance on this thread — is it a nothingburger, or an indication of existential threat to community governance and self-sovereignity — and what steps, if any, do you plan to take to insulate the project against the threat, should it it materialise into something more concrete than online bickering.

And as a corollary to that, what does Nix governance and self-sovereignity means for you, do you feel it’s an important aspect for the SC to work towards and what would your be general policy to handle potential threats stemming from external actors looking to control the project to their own ends. Consider what limits — if any — you would seek to put on such a threat actor, how — if at all — could that extend to functions community members associated with them could perform at a maintainer and/or governance levels, for example to ensure the threat actor cannot pressure them into acting against the project's best interests.

<summary>politics of tech and governing values (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487">link</a>)</summary>

Whereas the existing Nix projects have licenses already, one popular adage states technology is not neutral - perhaps increasingly obviously so, as the impact of technology continues to grow.

As such, zooming out a bit, one of the topics the community has seen different takes on seems whether we should govern by certain values, as exemplified by actions such as the earlier open letter against MIC sponsorships, a sentiment that seemed represented among contributors, or 'keep politics out', a sentiment that has seemed represented more at e.g. the NixOS sub-reddit.

<summary>Who are "The Nix Community", and why? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/436">link</a>)</summary>

One outcome of the NCA was the "Constitution", which advertises "Values". It falls short, however, of "constituting a community": it does not attempt to describe anything resembling a "membership predicate", a matter that was intensively discussed in the Governance Zulip. I'm interested in the candidates' reasoning and reflection about the community's composition, but here's also a few litmus tests:

- Are DetSys and Anduril "part of the community"?
- Is Jon Ringer "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Is srid "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Generally, how does moderation action affect "community membership"?
- Are former maintainers, who resigned in support of either of the two Open Letters, "part of the community"?
  - If they have not contributed back to the project since?
  - If they participate in discussions on Discourse or in Social Media?
  - If they contribute only to forks?
  - If they contribute to forks, but backport ad hoc?
- Are Lix, Snix, the Foundation, or the nix-community "part of the community"?
- Are NixCon Sponsors "part of the community"?
- Of participants of Nix-Offtopic and Discourse, are those, who do not "contribute" code, documentation, or decision-making, still "part of the community"?

Finally,

- Are people who disagree with the composition or the priorities of the "Values" part of the community?

I would like to specifically add that the party in question might escalate the matter into the court of public opinion.

In the answers from the previous year there was a very clear dividing line among candidates about not only using explicit powers granted by the constitution, versus using activism.

Would you advocate for the SC using activism proactively?
Would you advocate for the SC using activism once a matter is moved into the court of public opinion?
How do you think the SC should react to activism?
At what point should the SC concede to activist pressures?

Adding to that footnote, I also don't mean to say this is hat happened recently or want to litigate specific recent events, I'm interested in other candidates general view on these kinds of issues.

<summary>How are you planning to reconcile conflicts between SC and Nix team? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/285">link</a>)</summary>

Nix is a central piece of the ecosystem, and Nix team holds authority over it. Additionally, many Nix team members are a long-time, trusted community members, making them overwhelmingly more likely to be elected. One of the purposes of SC is to coordinate different teams; this poses a clear conflict of interest, when someone is in both Nix team and SC, as that person's interests as an SC member and Nix team member are not necessarily aligned.

How is such a conflict of interest planned to be addressed, or resolved?

<summary>How are you going to reform SC? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/284">link</a>)</summary>

To me, SC results were disappointing. Despite the community having clearly cast their votes, not much of substance was achieved in a year. This is indicative of a "committee" situation: where consensus is required to make any decisions. This poses an existential threat to the effectiveness of SC, as SC is meant to represent very diverse parts of the community, that often have conflicting interests. Achieving consensus in such a case is a pipe dream.

That's why SC members need a lot more autonomy, to be able to make decisions on their own (overriden by majority, if significant opposition arises) and not get blocked by achieving impossible consensus. This is the entire purpose of SC, as consensus-driven decisions were made with RFCs, and ran into all the same issues.

Considering this, how would you reform the SC to allow for more individual action and autonomy?
