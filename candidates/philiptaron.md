## Conflict of interest disclosure

I'm employed by [Qumulo](https://www.qumulo.com) as a Principal Member of Technical Staff. We use Nix internally as part of our build and test processes.

## Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

**I'm running to make the Steering Committee transparent, present, and courageous.** I want the Nix community to be stable, kind, generous, diverse, and growing — and I have faith my work can help make that possible.

I'm heartsick by the ways in which the Nix community and its leadership **currently do not foster these values**. Rather than stability, there's often silence. Instead of kindness, there's an ethos of perfectionism leading to unkindness being a norm. Instead of generosity, there's deep suspicion. I'm sad at the ways in which diversity isn't honored but is discarded. And most importantly for the long-term health of the community, by the ways that growth is looked at with suspicion rather than delight.

My motivation for [accepting the endorsements](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/pull/238) of the diverse set of folks from around the community is to be part of changing that on the Steering Committee. I'm commited to working together for Nix and the Nix ecosystem to do good. My promise is to work to create an enduring leadership team that is responsive, humble, open, and courageous as it [implements the Nix values](https://nixos.org/values/).

## What I have done

I've been using Nix since the early days (2016), but I bounced off its complexity a few times. I'm indebted to the writing of [Graham Christensen](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/), of [Gabriella Gonzalez](https://www.haskellforall.com/2022/08/stop-calling-everything-nix.html), of [Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/blog/nix-flakes-2-2022-02-27/), and of [Jade](https://jade.fyi/blog/building-nix-derivations-manually/) to name just a few, whose work made Nix legible to me.

My very first contribution was [#252637](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/252637) back in August 2023, not so long ago! Since then, I've contributed about 250 PRs throughout Nixpkgs and its associated tools, focusing on Nixpkgs CI, the standard environment (`stdenv`), and internal refactoring for quality, performance, and readability.

But my biggest contributions aren't PRs. I've reviewed and helped merge over **800 PRs**, many of which I was the sole reviewer and merger. I'm proudest of unblocking significant stuck PRs like [@ShamrockLee's `lib.extendMkDerivation`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/234651): reviewing in depth, continuing to engage, and pushing for explicit decisions to merge or reject. I'm proud of being called "merge-happy"[^1]. That's putting my time and attention toward helping others' work actually benefit our enormous userbase. That's what I will do on the Steering Committee.

[^1]: As @wolfgangwalther called me. I'll gladly take the label, even though I _try_ to be judicious.

## What I'll do

With 5 of 7 seats up for election, real reform is possible. Here's what I'll work for:

### Transparency

The first key reform is transparency. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. 
The current SC too often says nothing when called on to speak. From outside, it looks like anticipatory coverup — and [those never work](https://kajsotala.substack.com/p/how-anticipatory-cover-ups-go-wrong). This lack of transparency breeds conspiratorial thinking and actual conspiracies.

Let's speak and show our work, even when it's in progress. I support mechanisms like [@niklaskorz's non-voting observers](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/blob/main/candidates/niklaskorz.md), published minutes, and voting records. I'll work to make transparency structural and permanent.

### Reducing absenteeism

Being available is the first part of the job. I can't force others to work, but I'll show up myself and propose mechanisms to unwedge things when people can't. Putting a clock on decisions and taking action requires courage, but creates massive, compounding positive outcomes.

### Allow public disagreement

While I love consensus, insisting on it creates leadership by lowest common denominator, paralysis, burnout, and silence when courage is needed. When consensus fails repeatedly, the only real choice is division or exile — and we've seen this over and over. There are all sorts of minority views in our community, and finding norms which include them, do not stifle them, but do not cater to them is absolutely key to creating a truly diverse community.

To heal the gap, we need to disagree and commit, sometimes publicly. Democracy is powered by both debate and voting, where the minority commits to staying in the body despite not ending on top of the vote, and the majority commits to continuing to include them in the next debate.

## How I'll do it

### By showing up

My record of reviewing and merging PRs is clear: I show up consistently, day after day, week after week. You can count on me to be part of _doing the work_, whatever the work of the day is.

### By being courageous _and_ judicious

I'm merge-happy. I'm willing to "send it", and I'm willing to admit when I'm wrong and be the one clicking the revert button. Though it's not my favorite thing, I'm happy to be wrong in public, especially when the alternative is never speaking at all. But I also value thoughtfulness and due diligence, as evidenced by the review feedback I write. Courage _and_ caution are part of the best of us. I'll use them on the Steering Committee.

### By supporting and empowering others

The SC's job isn't to do the work itself, but to ensure an environment where the best work can be done. That means creating structures like the [Nixpkgs Core Team](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/establishing-the-nixpkgs-core-team/69743) and actually supporting what they do with alacrity rather than suspicion. That includes feedback but not micromanagement or nitpicking.

Yes, that absolutely includes empowering the moderation team to do their essential work without treating moderation like a software program with bugs. The recent decision to interfere with the moderation team is an unforced error, and I would never have voted in favor of it.

### By focusing on Nixpkgs

Nixpkgs is the crown jewel of the Nix ecosystem. While Eelco's PhD thesis is brilliant, most insightful PhD works remain insights without impact. But the impact of Nixpkgs is enormous. It's a repository where almost all open source software from almost every ecosystem exists in a continuously buildable state. There's no reason to suspect that given Nix-the-tool, Nixpkgs would necessarily result or remain as coherent as it has.

More than any other factor, Nixpkgs makes me believe in the greater Nix ecosystem.

Making sure Nixpkgs remains healthy amid proliferating evaluators, installers, operating systems, and supply chain threats is my most important technical priority. I'll accomplish this not through my own work, but by making sure those doing the work have what they need.

## Closing statement

Nix-the-idea and Nixpkgs-the-reality have changed how we experience software daily. Yet in the grander scope, we've yet to make an impact. I believe adopting Nix will impact the software ecosystem as profoundly as the integrated circuit impacted hardware. Packaging unlocks latent value trapped in silos. In a world where humans aren't the only code authors, it enables safety amid exponentially more churn.

I want to be part of that. I want to help lead that. With your vote, I promise I'll do my part to make real the promise of Nix.


## Q&A

### Should the SC vote for confidence instead of for no-confidence? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472))


The [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#full-reelections) reads:

> A simple majority within the SC may call a reelection of the entire SC based on perceived loss of confidence.

This can lead to a 3-3 deadlock as we [currently](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) [see](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/6). In this deadlock, neither the reelection, nor any majority vote can pass - the SC is unable to function.

**In many legislatures, this is flipped into a vote of confidence that must pass to avoid a re-election.** This would have the same results for a full SC, but avoid situations like the current 3-3 deadlock.

Do you support amending the constitution accordingly?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472#issuecomment-3358180301">link</a>)</summary>

Yes, I support turning the mechanism into a vote of confidence through an amendment to the constitution.

Edit 2025/10/02: Having read @JulienMalka's finessed version, that's even better, and supports stability in a way the previous version did not.

### How would you handle an SC member joining Anduril? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190))


Recently, current SC member Tom Bereknyei took a new job at Anduril. After parts of the community [criticized](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971) the SC for not communicating this publicly, the SC gave a [statement](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/statement-on-a-steering-committee-member-joining-anduril/69007).

As an SC member, how would you like the SC to handle such a situation in the future?

The first and primary plank of my candidacy for the SC is [**transparency**](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/blob/main/candidates/philiptaron.md#transparency). Sunlight is the best disinfectant[^2]. The current SC too often says nothing when called on to speak. From outside, it looks like anticipatory coverup — and [those never work](https://kajsotala.substack.com/p/how-anticipatory-cover-ups-go-wrong). The situation sketched above is a case in point.

So, if something is controversial or I _think_ it's going to be controversial, I will choose to be **more** communicative, not less.

Had I been in the current SC's shoes, I would have strongly urged Tom to disclose this in a post on Discourse, and to encourage the moderation team to ensure that the community follow through on the [values of respect and civility](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/values.md#respect-and-civility) as they responded to the news.

Were the same situation to occur, I would do the same as sketched above.

Unlike my friends @drupol and @niklaskorz, I don't see a need to legislate this particular situation into a rule or a constitutional amendment.[^1] But I do call on all SC candidates to pledge to working in public and being transparent about their employment. It's good for the community, and it's good for them.

### Should Nix transition away from GitHub to a self-hosted git forge? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/326))


(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/18 from the 2024 election)

Do you believe Nix should move away from GitHub and instead host its independent Git forge? If so, what are the benefits and challenges of such a transition, and how would you approach this shift if it were to happen?

If you already answered last year, it would probably totally be fine to just copy that answer.

**No**. The benefits are too low and the costs are too high. Protecting and growing the contributing community to Nixpkgs is [tremendously more important](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/blob/main/candidates/philiptaron.md#by-focusing-on-nixpkgs).

That said, a good number of folks are running Nixpkgs forks in other forges, and I support and would merge changes to the Nixpkgs CI infrastructure making their lives easier. Ping me on the PR.

### Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265))


In https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html, current SC member Gabriella argues that 7 members are too many for the SC to operate efficiently and effectively.

With the experience we made after one year: Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265#issuecomment-3361362783">link</a>)</summary>

The problems Gabriella identifies are real, but they're symptoms of absenteeism and weak processes, not committee size. A 5-member committee with 2 absent members is worse than a 7-member committee with 5 active ones.

Before we reduce representation, let's fix the real problems:

1. **Make attendance transparent**. Publish meeting minutes and voting records. If a member misses X[^1] consecutive meetings/votes, trigger a vote for/against a special election among the remainder of the SC.[^2]
2. **Put clocks on decisions**. Absenteeism shouldn't create veto power. Clear deadlines and quorum rules prevent paralysis.
3. **Allow public disagreement**. Consensus is great, but insisting on it creates paralysis. We need to be able to disagree, vote, and commit—even when we're in the minority.

A 7-member SC allows broader representation of our diverse, global community. That's valuable. But it only works if all 7 members show up and do the work.

My position: **Fix the processes first**. If after one term of structural transparency and accountability the SC still can't function, then I'll support reducing the size. But we owe it to the community to try a fully-present, well-run 7-member committee before we conclude the structure itself is broken.

[^1]: What X is ought to be discussed in more detail than this issue affords.
[^2]: Since the votes are public, this allows the community to see how and ideally _why_ the decision to call or not call a special election has been made. I'm not a fan of automatic instability: it's better to put humans in the loop.

### How would you treat SC members with completely opposite political leanings? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/489))


As the title suggests, if some SC members have completely different political affiliations and governance ideas than you, and often disagree with you on decision-making, how would you treat them? How would you ensure that you fulfill your responsibilities?

More seriously, if you find that the faction you represent is not the majority in the SC, what will you do?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/489#issuecomment-3376700171">link</a>)</summary>

I don’t think of myself as representing a faction, and I hope the community doesn’t elect me that way. I’m running on specific commitments: transparency, showing up, empowering teams, and working in public. All of these are ways of focusing our contribution so that what divides us in other areas won't divide us in the shared Nix mission.

### On disagreement and diversity

We’re a global community. Different viewpoints aren’t a problem to solve: they’re proof of the diversity that can make us strong. I believe in the [Nix values](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/values.md#the-values) of respect and civility, prioritizing people, wide autonomy with real decision-making power, automation to reduce toil, and stable evolution. These form a basis for unity without paving over the real disagreements that exist.

If I find myself in the minority on the SC (which will happen!) I’ll do what democracy requires: make my case, vote my conscience, and commit to the decision we make together, insofar as I can. 

One of my core platform points is that [we need to allow public disagreement](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/blob/main/candidates/philiptaron.md#allow-public-disagreement). When we can’t disagree openly and still work together, the only options left are silence or exile, and we’ve seen both. So I _will_ disagree in public about decisions where I'm in the minority if I think it's wise to do so. This isn't to re-litigate issues in the court of public opinion. It's a necessary part of transparency, and the alternatives (as we have seen) are worse.

### A model that already works

We actually have a template for this in Nixpkgs itself. Every day, people with different technical philosophies and priorities work together productively. We have substantial disagreements -- about CI workflows, about breaking changes, about architecture decisions -- but those disagreements are about *the work*, not *the people*. And they happen in public, with the same participants committing to working with each other PR by PR, no matter if *this* PR is merged or not.

That culture of low-grade collaboration builds increasing trust over time. It’s how we achieve [stable evolution over stagnation or chaos](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/values.md#stable-evolution-over-stagnation-or-chaos). That’s the model for how a functional SC can work.

### My commitment

I welcome dialogue with anyone, especially people who disagree with me. If we have differences, let’s talk them out directly rather than letting them fester. With some of you reading this, you know this first-hand: I spend time finding common ground. I treat everyone with [respect and civility](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/values.md#respect-and-civility), take arguments seriously, assume good faith, and focus on the work.

My responsibilities to voters don’t require being in the majority. I can show up, be transparent, push for reforms, and support teams regardless of vote counts. Some commitments need majority support. I'm willing to play the longer, more patient game seeking to accomplish those aims.

### The hopeful part

The Nix community is diverse: politically, technically, geographically, in every way. The SC should demonstrate that people with different views can work together effectively. *We already know how to do this.* The Nixpkgs community proves it every day. The SC just needs to work the way Nixpkgs works: focus on the work, build trust through collaboration, and keep showing up.

### Community participant behaviour regarding moderation decisions ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/477))

The [constitution explicitly mentions](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#conflict-of-interest-coi-balance) "employees of the same company or otherwise the same payer for Nix work" as *examples* of Conflicts of Interest for the constitution of the SC.

In the current SC, we had three members of the Nix team (Ericson2314, roberth, tomberek) and two members of the commit bit delegation team (jtojnar, winterqt), which arguably reduces diversity as well.

Should team-memberships in the community also be considered as Conflicts of Interest for the SC election? Why (not)?

**No**, for two reasons.

## Meritocracy

The Nix community, broadly speaking, is a meritocracy where stake in the community is expressed by the work done. I would be very glad to see you (@wolfgangwalther) and _every other member_ of the Nixpkgs core team be on the Steering Committee, even if it meant I wasn't on it. This is due to the quality of work you have displayed.

## Diversity 

The stated purpose of the [conflict of interest check](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#conflict-of-interest-coi-balance) is to increase the diversity of the steering committee. Holding multiple seats in the community gives the steering committee member insight into what doing the work is actually like. I see it as increasing their own internal diversity. This would only become a problem if the person wasn't able to fulfill all their signed-up-for responsibilities, which is not a conflict-of-interest problem but an _interests in conflict_ problem! 🙂 

### Postscript

That said, membership in the Nix-the-tool team without participating actively in Nixpkgs is indeed a problem. It's not a conflict-of-interest problem, and shouldn't be solved using that tool. I believe that [Nixpkgs is the crown jewel of the Nix community](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/blob/main/candidates/philiptaron.md#by-focusing-on-nixpkgs), and I want the community -- which overwhelmingly exists and collaborates in Nixpkgs -- to elect people who care about Nixpkgs and want to see it thrive.

### How would you act on the moderation team's call to SC candidates? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/390))


When a large part of the moderation team [stepped down](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828) they asked for:

> **We call on the SC candidates:** to commit to implementing a Constitution reform that will require transparency and accountability from the SC, with teams like technical steering and moderation providing a counterbalance.

How would you act as a member of the next SC in this matter?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/390#issuecomment-3361478311">link</a>)</summary>

The moderation team's request cuts to the heart of what I'm running on: transparency and empowerment, not micromanagement.

### On transparency and accountability

I'm committed to structural reforms that make SC work visible and individual members accountable. Here's the top three, as I see it.

- Published meeting minutes and voting records with individual attribution
- Clear mechanisms for addressing absenteeism (as I've detailed in https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265#issuecomment-3361362783)
- Working in public, especially when we're stuck

But transparency alone isn't enough. The SC has been both opaque *and* overreaching - and I think that comes from good people being overwhelmed, not from malice.

### On counterbalancing power

The SC's job is to create conditions where teams can do their best work, not to do the work ourselves or second-guess every decision. That means:

- **Technical decisions belong to technical teams.** The Nixpkgs Core Team, Nix team, infrastructure team - they have authority in their domains. The SC coordinates and resolves escalations, but doesn't micromanage technical choices. That's what **steering** means.

- **Moderation decisions belong to moderators.** The recent interference with the moderation team breaks my heart - not because there was bad faith, but because it shows how badly our structures were failing everyone involved. Moderators need to believe in the policies they enforce. When the SC can't trust the moderation team's judgment, the answer is dialogue - and if that fails completely, working *with the community* to reconstitute the team, not overriding decisions case-by-case.

Human beings aren't code that needs a minimal patch. As this whole episode has shown, it's all connected.

### My commitment

I support mechanisms similar to what Rust's Leadership Council implemented - mutual accountability where teams can check SC overreach. But the foundation is simpler: **delegate authority, provide support, and only escalate when teams themselves ask for it**.

The moderation team stepped down because the SC both failed to support them *and* undermined their authority. I don't think the current SC wanted that outcome. But good intentions aren't enough when the structures themselves are broken. If I'm elected, I'll work to ensure the SC does its actual job: creating the conditions for teams to succeed, then getting out of their way.

## Rebuilding together

We owe it to everyone who's been hurt - moderators, SC members, community members - to build something better. Our [community values](https://nixos.org/values/) call us to treat each other with respect and civility, and to build trust primarily by working together on Nix projects. That's the path forward: not perfect structures or perfect people, but committed people working together in good faith with the humility to admit when we're wrong and the courage to do better. I'm ready to do that work.
</details>

### How should the SC communicate with the community? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199))


The [list of official announcements](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/announcements/steering-committee/57) from the first year of SC starts with two general updates in November and December 24, then continues with only specific announcement on certain topics. Even if a bit delayed, the Foundation has given [more updates](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/meta/nixos-foundation/47).

Arguably there was not much insight for the community into what the SC was working on.

How would an SC with you as a member, communicate with the community?

<details>

**Showing up in public is job number one.** The SC's communication failures stem from a deeper problem: absenteeism and dysfunction become radio silence, which breeds distrust.

My goal is **consistent, useful communication that actually steers the community** — not "transparency theater" without actual transparency. That means the following things.

#### Working in the open

- Public meeting minutes (with rare, justified redactions)
- Published voting records with individual attribution
- Regular activity summaries that show our current focus and upcoming decisions

These aren't ends in themselves. They're tools to give the community the information they need to participate effectively and hold us accountable.

#### Taking responsibility for decisions

Individual voting records matter. When we make decisions, you should know who voted for what and why. This prevents the SC from hiding behind collective ambiguity and ensures members can't dodge accountability. **Every member of the SC should want this.**

#### No strategic silence

If the SC goes quiet, it's usually because we're stuck internally. That's exactly when we should speak up. If there's a deadlock, bring it public. If there's disagreement, show it. Silence during conflict looks like coverup and *creates* the conspiracies we're trying to avoid.

#### Building trust through work

Ultimately, [we build trust the Nix way](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/values.md#distribute-decisionmaking-widely): by working together on actual problems. Communication supports that work, but can't replace it. The SC should be visible not just in announcements, but in contributions, discussions, and follow-through.

#### My commitment to you

The pattern I'm committed to: show up, do the work, explain the reasoning, take responsibility, and stay consistent. When that breaks down, fix it publicly rather than going dark.

### What would be some concrete steps you would take in the first few months? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/195))


Please mention some concrete steps you would take in the first few months after being elected to the SC.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/195#issuecomment-3352309843">link</a>)</summary>

The moderation situation that's developed over the past week needs immediate attention. Without a working moderation system, our spaces can and do devolve into places where collaboration cannot happen.

### First month: Establish transparency and stabilize moderation

My immediate priority is transparency. I'll push to publish notes from every SC meeting, establish voting records, and implement observer mechanisms. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and the current silence breeds exactly the kind of distrust that led us here.

On moderation: I'll work to establish an interim structure within days, not weeks. The former moderation team deserves to be heard, and I'll make sure that happens—but we can't leave our community spaces in limbo while we talk. We need both speed and care.

### Months 2-3: Structural reform to prevent repeat failures

I'll work with other SC members to draft constitutional amendments that emphasize that the role of the SC is to *steer* not *manage*. The recent interference with the moderation team was wrong, and I want to make sure it doesn't happen again. That means giving away some SC power—and I'm completely comfortable with that.

This process will be collaborative: working with the new SC, former moderators, current teams, and the community to design a framework where moderation can function independently. The Nix constitutional assembly is my north star of what that process looks like.

But I'll also put clocks on these discussions. Consensus is valuable, but paralysis is deadly.

### Throughout: Show up and unblock

My track record speaks for itself: 800+ PRs reviewed and merged. I show up. I'll bring that same energy to governance—reviewing stalled decisions weekly, putting timers on paralyzed discussions, and being willing to vote even when it's uncomfortable.

I'm merge-happy in code, and I'll be decision-happy on the SC. Sometimes that means being wrong in public. I'm okay with that. The alternative—silence and inaction—is worse.

## The core principle: Courage with care

I won't choose between moving fast and listening carefully. We need both. The moderation crisis requires immediate action **and** deep understanding. Structural reform requires bold changes **and** collaborative design. I'll work to do both, because our community deserves leadership that's both courageous and present.

### Voter mechanisms to recall individual candidates ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482))


Over the past days, there have been [multiple](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971/) [calls](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/) for individual SC candidates to step down, or even calling for a [full reelection](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/).

Current procedures have yet to take into account such desires, meaning we would currently depend on either:

- SC members voting one another out (re: individual SC members)
- SC votes of no confidence (c.f. #472)

Would you rather see such a formal mechanism to retroactively retract/amend votes or recall individual delegates? If yes, what should this look like? If not, why not?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482#issuecomment-3374655658">link</a>)</summary>

Stability is really important. @pluiedev has it right: 

1. Recalls would be logistically difficult to track.
2. They would destabilize the Steering Council by allowing frequent composition changes.
3. Votes of confidence ([with adjustments](https://github.com/NixOS/org/pull/181)) provide sufficient mechanisms to indicate that the SC isn't working.
4. Voters should trust their elected candidates' judgment for the full term rather than treating recalls as routine.

So, **we should adopt no new mechanisms**. As I wrote in https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265#issuecomment-3361362783:

> My position: **Fix the processes first**. If after one term of structural transparency and accountability the SC still can't function, then I'll support reducing the size[^1]. But we owe it to the community to try a fully-present, well-run 7-member committee before we conclude the structure itself is broken.

### How should the SC deal with people in the org chart not respecting their authority? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/491))


This question is based on a question from the previous year: https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114
> **Title: What's the best way for the steering committee to deal with inaction or being ignored?**
> One of the main ways in which the previous Nix governance has been criticized is for ignoring or being inactive in the face of community protests and concerns.[1](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#user-content-fn-1-be51383cd9081764e2d5d66461ad8100)
> 
> Let's suppose that the steering committee is now responsive to the community... but when the steering committee asks for or directs action, that request is ignored, de-prioritized, or litigated by the relevant parties.

>
> [1]: I'm not interested in rehashing or re-litigating these specific cases or people involved; please do not do so in your answer. [↩](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#user-content-fnref-1-be51383cd9081764e2d5d66461ad8100)

I would like to specifically add that the party in question might escalate the matter into the court of public opinion.

In the answers from the previous year there was a very clear dividing line among candidates about not only using explicit powers granted by the constitution, versus using activism.

Would you advocate for the SC using activism proactively?
Would you advocate for the SC using activism once a matter is moved into the court of public opinion?
How do you think the SC should react to activism?
At what point should the SC concede to activist pressures?

Adding to that footnote, I also don't mean to say this is hat happened recently or want to litigate specific recent events, I'm interested in other candidates general view on these kinds of issues.

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/491#issuecomment-3379116262">link</a>)</summary>

Hey, I asked that question a year ago!

So I'm running on a platform of [transparency](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/blob/main/candidates/philiptaron.md#transparency), [reducing absenteeism](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/blob/main/candidates/philiptaron.md#reducing-absenteeism), and [disagreeing in public](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/blob/main/candidates/philiptaron.md#allow-public-disagreement) to break through deadlocks. It's my belief that by doing so, we'll enable a more effective and engaged steering committee. As I've [noted before](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/489#issuecomment-3376700171), that's the way that Nixpkgs works, and it's a model for how the SC could work too.

It also has the natural consequence of shifting from "hard power" (management of teams, declaration of decisions, and so forth) to "soft power" (notes, intentions, requests, and publicity).

Many of [the responses a year ago](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114) focus on the downsides of "soft power" and accentuate the upsides of using "hard power" as enumerated in the constitution.[^1]

My take: that's viewing society as if it were software. Persuading people isn't a matter of taking a vote and enacting it. It engenders precisely the sorts of escalations that have _consumed_ the community over the past week or so.

So let's shift the methods. That's not activism. It's soft power. It's using public appreciation to build trust. It's having a respectful and civil conversation, usually in public and only sometimes in private. It's being amenable to feedback _before_ the consequences can't be rolled back. 

Using these tools, my hope is the next Steering Committee can help achieve the ambitious aims of Nix without deluding itself about its coercive power.

[^1]: If power means the ability to get (or influence directly) the outcomes one wants’ from others (mainly by coercion or inducements) then soft power is ‘the ability to shape the preferences of others’. If ‘the others’ want the same thing because we share the same worldview, outlook and culture, we can enlist their power in achieving ‘our’ goal. -- [Soft Power](https://www.diplomacy.edu/resource/soft-power-the-means-to-success-in-world-politics/)

### What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to community and Foundation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337))


(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/34 from 2024 election)

What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to the community? Should they be linked on the homepage? If so, should they be compelled to comply with the Foundation's code of conduct? Should we attempt to convert these communities into official spaces (if so, at what point)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337#issuecomment-3378933215">link</a>)</summary>

My priority is **enabling contributors to do work together effectively.** That happens primarily in Nixpkgs, which is on GitHub today, with no realistic alternative. The SC's limited energy should focus there first, in concert with the Nixpkgs core team: reducing toil in PRs and issues, making collaboration smoother, and living out our values where the entire open source ecosystem joins together.

### On unofficial spaces

I'm glad they exist. Reddit, Discord, and much of the community conversation space on X, Bluesky, and the Fediverse serve crucial functions, especially user help and community building. My hope is that every space in the Nix universe lives out our values of respect, civility, and prioritizing people. But hope isn't the same as control.

### Should they be linked on the homepage?

Sure, if they're genuinely useful to newcomers. Linking isn't endorsement of everything that happens there; it's acknowledgment that people congregate there and find value. Marking them with "unofficial" seems wise. And we should always feel free to drop the recommendation if the situation warrants it.

### Should they comply with our CoC?

Only if they choose to become official spaces. Making that choice means accepting moderation structures and the Nix code of conduct. It's a real commitment, not a formality.

### Should we convert them?

There's no "we" and "them" here. Many of my friends from GitHub are present on these unofficial forums. The folks which moderate these spaces are present here in the official spaces, too.

If a community wants to become official, the SC is and ought to be open to those conversations. **An authoritarian bid for control contradicts our value of distributing decision-making widely.**

### The practical reality

With limited resources, invest where it matters most. Make Nixpkgs collaboration excellent. Support the official spaces we have. Welcome unofficial spaces that want to join us on their timeline. And rather than trying to police every corner of the internet where Nix gets discussed, **focus on modeling the behavior and culture we want to see in the spaces we *do* moderate.**

If unofficial spaces become actively harmful through brigading, bullying, or worse... that's a different conversation. One without easy answers and lots of heartbreak. But the baseline should be decentralization, not consolidation.

### How can contributing to Nix-the-implementation be made easier? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196))


It has repeatedly been mentioned in the past, that contributing to [Nix](https://github.com/nixos/nix) is hard.

What are the reasons for this from your perspective and how can this be improved?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196#issuecomment-3352002280">link</a>)</summary>

I'm a [principal member of technical staff at Qumulo](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/blob/main/candidates/philiptaron.md#conflict-of-interest-disclosure), where we build a distributed filesystem managing many exabytes of storage across thousands of customers. The stakes are existential: losing data is completely unacceptable, even in the face of stacked hardware failures. I oversee and help author large chunks of a 3 million line C codebase—1.2 million lines of product code, 1.8 million lines of test code. It's really high quality, with multilayered tests of units, systems, integration, chaos scenarios, and property-based tests. We ship to production every two weeks. Looking at the past two weeks, there are about 1000 commits, roughly 65k lines added and 41k deleted, involving about 45 contributors (the most prolific making 10% of changes). 

I share this background because I have personal, ongoing experience that it's possible to create a **thriving product** and **high-quality collaboration culture** in a language that's very few people's first choice today.

The Nix team does great work, but they're quite bottlenecked on people. When there are few people, prioritization becomes incredibly important because resources are scarce. This creates what I call a **scarcity spiral**: few resources lead to short-term decision making, which leaves you still in a situation with scarce resources, which reinforces the pattern. It's expensive to be poor. The way out of this spiral is to intentionally prioritize adding people to the project who have the right of code submission, with two critical caveats. First, that right can and should be revoked if used unwisely. Second, there is a duty of trust—analogous to Qumulo's duty to never lose data—that means contributions need to prove they work correctly, and the tests demonstrating correctness are often *more* important than the code itself.

There is no immediate action that will solve this issue overnight. What's required is incremental, compounding action over time. The Steering Committee's role here is two-fold: **don't add even more barriers**, and **encourage (steer!) the Nix team towards living out the stated value**: "Our leaders have a duty to find, support, and promote new contributors—and eventually step aside for new leaders." This means actively removing friction from the contributor pipeline, celebrating when commit rights are granted to new people, and treating the growth of the maintainer base as a first-class success metric alongside feature development. Breaking the scarcity spiral requires trusting new people before it feels comfortable to do so, with the safety net of robust testing and the understanding that trust, once given, can be calibrated over time.

<summary>How transparent should the SC be? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407">link</a>)</summary>

In a [blog post](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html), resigned SC member @Gabriella439 recommended future SCs to increase transparency toward the community. (A different recommendation there, regarding SC size, is the subject of #265.)

In particular, the argument for this went (non-header emphasis mine):

> **Poor self-organization and internal policies/procedures**

[...]

> I think one of the big mistakes we made was that we insisted on **“speaking with one voice”**, meaning that we could not make any meaningful external statements or comments without getting majority approval from the committee (something we had difficulty with on the regular). This is why the committee remained largely silent or slow-to-respond on a large number of issues.

> This problem got bad enough that at some point many members began to break the wall of silence by commenting in an unofficial capacity on high-profile issues so that outsiders would get some visibility into what was going on instead of waiting for us to completely the slow process of gathering enough consensus and votes.

> Another internal policy that I believe was counter-productive was **not disclosing the final votes** on various issues or requiring individual signatories on public statements. Had we done this it would have likely broken a lot of internal stalemates and filibusters if all committee members were held publicly accountable for their policy positions (and therefore subject to public pressure).

> It would have also helped with another issue, which was:

> **Absenteeism**

> For various reasons (some justifiable, some not), at many points in time a large number of committee members would be unreachable, even during crucial junctures like ongoing controversy. This absenteeism was masked by the committee not publicizing that fact earlier. **If we had required all votes to be publicly recorded and all statements to require individual signatories** it would have exposed this absenteeism earlier (and led to quicker corrections).

As such, I would like to ask SC candidates: how do you regard the topic of SC transparency in light of @Gabriella439's recommendations, if not more generally? Further, how would you concretely enact these views in the SC, if elected?

I’ve seen different metaphors for what moderators are supposed to be. Some say moderators are like cops (enforcing rules), others say they’re like paramedics (helping people in crisis).

But no one has made the case for moderators as _judges_. If moderators are indeed tasked with enforcing rules, who then plays the role of the judiciary in our governance model? Do you think mods alone should be able to decide on the punishment (especially lifetime bans)?

The recent SC turmoil had been commented on outside the community in various venues. In particular, I'd like to draw attention to this [Twitter thread](https://xcancel.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1972037286192992320) where certain individuals talk about _“get[ting] these nut jobs out”_ and that _“[M]aybe @<!-- -->PalmerLuckey can help turn the ship around.”_ While the Anduril founder does not acknowledge those proposals directly, he says this:

> The good news is that Anduril will keep using Nix to build ever more powerful weapons for American dominance regardless of what the fringe "community" people say.

The question is, what is your stance on this thread — is it a nothingburger, or an indication of existential threat to community governance and self-sovereignity — and what steps, if any, do you plan to take to insulate the project against the threat, should it it materialise into something more concrete than online bickering.

And as a corollary to that, what does Nix governance and self-sovereignity means for you, do you feel it’s an important aspect for the SC to work towards and what would your be general policy to handle potential threats stemming from external actors looking to control the project to their own ends. Consider what limits — if any — you would seek to put on such a threat actor, how — if at all — could that extend to functions community members associated with them could perform at a maintainer and/or governance levels, for example to ensure the threat actor cannot pressure them into acting against the project's best interests.

<summary>politics of tech and governing values (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487">link</a>)</summary>

Whereas the existing Nix projects have licenses already, one popular adage states technology is not neutral - perhaps increasingly obviously so, as the impact of technology continues to grow.

As such, zooming out a bit, one of the topics the community has seen different takes on seems whether we should govern by certain values, as exemplified by actions such as the earlier open letter against MIC sponsorships, a sentiment that seemed represented among contributors, or 'keep politics out', a sentiment that has seemed represented more at e.g. the NixOS sub-reddit.

One outcome of the NCA was the "Constitution", which advertises "Values". It falls short, however, of "constituting a community": it does not attempt to describe anything resembling a "membership predicate", a matter that was intensively discussed in the Governance Zulip. I'm interested in the candidates' reasoning and reflection about the community's composition, but here's also a few litmus tests:

- Are DetSys and Anduril "part of the community"?
- Is Jon Ringer "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Is srid "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Generally, how does moderation action affect "community membership"?
- Are former maintainers, who resigned in support of either of the two Open Letters, "part of the community"?
  - If they have not contributed back to the project since?
  - If they participate in discussions on Discourse or in Social Media?
  - If they contribute only to forks?
  - If they contribute to forks, but backport ad hoc?
- Are Lix, Snix, the Foundation, or the nix-community "part of the community"?
- Are NixCon Sponsors "part of the community"?
- Of participants of Nix-Offtopic and Discourse, are those, who do not "contribute" code, documentation, or decision-making, still "part of the community"?

Finally,

- Are people who disagree with the composition or the priorities of the "Values" part of the community?

<summary>Should electoral alliances/coalitions count as conflicts of interest? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/479">link</a>)</summary>

Related to #470.

It has been brought to my attention that several candidates are interested in forming electoral coalitions[^1] where candidates agree to vote for each other in time for the election. This could significantly change the result of the election, especially if coalitions decide to formalize which candidates they choose to vote for and which they do not, and if many members of the same coalition are elected to office, their shared interests could dominate the SC. In spite of this, there are currently no rules in place that will require electoral coalition/alliance status to be disclosed in each candidate's statement. 

Do you think participation in coalitions and alliances *has to be* disclosed? If not, do you think they *should* be disclosed?

[^1]: To be clear, *informal* alignments such as friendships do not count here — whether *those* should be counted as CoIs deserve a different issue altogether.

<summary>How are you planning to pursue a trademark? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/340">link</a>)</summary>

A trademark is direly needed, as there are many commercial projects who use "Nix" in their name for marketing purposes, sometimes confusingly. However, the trademark rules have to be reasonable for downstream users, and put clear guidelines. Furthermore, there might be conflicts if the trademark policy doesn't match a company's path. Additionally, it will require a clear set of guidelines between what each of Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS project constitutes, and how much "Nix" they share (possibly with renaming?)

How do you plan to handle this?

<summary>If you were in a previous SC, how would you vote on public issues? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/281">link</a>)</summary>

There were several decisions made by previous SC in response to community conflicts. They set an important benchmark to gauge candidate's decision-making. Those questions are:

    Allow Anduril to keep publishing jobs on Discourse?
    Replace PolyMC with Prism Launcher?
    What should be the policy on MIC participation?
    What should be the policy for telemetry?

What additional initiatives would you raise?

<summary>How do you want to structure communication with Determinate Systems? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/341">link</a>)</summary>

The title might seem excessively direct. However, last year, there was a question on MIC policy and Anduril ban. Since then, SC has enforced a ban on Anduril job posting. Anduril has been a very controversial company for the wide community; I feel like it's fitting to ask about another controversial company, and how to interact with it.

What are the problems you see with communication between Determinate Systems and NixOS Community? Are there concrete suggestions you have, or would like to propose? What other areas of work (Nix improvements, trademark policy, etc.) do you feel prevent healthy collaboration?

<summary>What are your thoughts on documentation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/339">link</a>)</summary>

Documentation is often cited as being lackluster, incomplete, or confusing. Personally, I disagree; I've seen many improvements to documentation over the years, and I think it has come a long way. Still, those improvements don't address the core issue for why documentation *feels* lackluster.

IMO, the issue is because the boundaries between projects are not clear. A new NixOS user will look at the NixOS manual for help: but really, they are using Nix+Nixpkgs+NixOS stack. For a beginner, it is not clear why there would be three manuals, and where the boundaries lie, and which manual they need (especially when interacting with a layering violation). This provides a frustrating experience, where despite the information being abundant, it is not at all discoverable in a relevant fashion.

Is this something that you are concerned with? What do you want to do with it? Direct more resources into cross-cutting documentation projects, like nix.dev or wiki.nixos.org ? Work on clearer project boundaries? Attempt to bridge documentation?

I am curious to hear your thoughts.

<summary>How are you planning to reconcile conflicts between SC and Nix team? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/285">link</a>)</summary>

Nix is a central piece of the ecosystem, and Nix team holds authority over it. Additionally, many Nix team members are a long-time, trusted community members, making them overwhelmingly more likely to be elected. One of the purposes of SC is to coordinate different teams; this poses a clear conflict of interest, when someone is in both Nix team and SC, as that person's interests as an SC member and Nix team member are not necessarily aligned.

How is such a conflict of interest planned to be addressed, or resolved?

<summary>What is your view on licensing? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/338">link</a>)</summary>

Right now, the ecosystem is very split between permissive licenses (MIT), copyleft-ish licenses (LGLP, MPL), and copyleft licenses (GPL). This signifies a wider disagreement between people on what community is, and what to expect.

Licenses are by no means perfect, but they signify intention and direction. They are like a COC: adopting one doesn't instantly solve all of your problems (nor is expected to), but it shows where the project is heading. This has a lot of consequences later down the line. It could be argued that Nixpkgs being MIT-licensed is a reason why there are so many companies hanging around it; it could likewise be argued that the reason DetSys hasn't been more successful with their "downstream distribution" has to do with LGPL.

What is your view on licensing? Are you planning to put out guidelines for licensing official and community projects? Pursue relicensing various projects?

<summary>How are you going to reform SC? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/284">link</a>)</summary>

To me, SC results were disappointing. Despite the community having clearly cast their votes, not much of substance was achieved in a year. This is indicative of a "committee" situation: where consensus is required to make any decisions. This poses an existential threat to the effectiveness of SC, as SC is meant to represent very diverse parts of the community, that often have conflicting interests. Achieving consensus in such a case is a pipe dream.

That's why SC members need a lot more autonomy, to be able to make decisions on their own (overriden by majority, if significant opposition arises) and not get blocked by achieving impossible consensus. This is the entire purpose of SC, as consensus-driven decisions were made with RFCs, and ran into all the same issues.

Considering this, how would you reform the SC to allow for more individual action and autonomy?

<summary>What is a "competing implementation", and should being involved in one constitute a conflict of interest? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/456">link</a>)</summary>

(This is a little targeted, though everyone is welcome to chime in with their thoughts, of course.)

In https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3354754312 you said that you're worried about the current definition of "conflict of interest" not including "being involved in competing implementations and communities, social media groups, country, military status, and so forth".

What is a "competing implementation" or "competing community" to you? What level of involvement would you consider significant enough to constitute CoI? What decisions are you expecting the SC to make where this CoI becomes an issue?

Also, once again, as a litmus test, would any of these people be considered to have a CoI?
- a Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc team member
- a Determinate Systems employee
- a Snix/Tvix/Lix/etc contributor
- a contibutor to both NixOS/nix and Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc
- a person present in Tvix/Snix/Lix/etc discussion spaces
- an Auxolotl/Ekala/etc contributor
- a contributor to both NixOS/nixpkgs and Ekala/Auxolotl/etc
- a person present in Auxolotl/Ekala/etc discussion spaces

Also, can you maybe name examples of social media groups or countries that would be considered to have a CoI, and why/when?

<summary>Currently sitting SC members running for reelection: why did you vote the way you did on a vote of no confidence on 2025-09-30? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/452">link</a>)</summary>

Today, [a reply by @jtojnar](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) on the whistleblowing post mentioned that the Steering Committee held a vote of no confidence today, 30 September 2025.

> Vote of no confidence of the entire SC 2025-09-30 (failed 3/6)
> * Ericson2314: -1
> * Gabriella439: +1
> * jtojnar: +1
> * roberth: -1
> * tomberek: -1
> * winterqt: +1

A "yes" vote to a vote of no confidence implies that the individual does not have trust in the SC. A "no" vote implies that there is still some trust left.

Why did you vote the way that you did?

<summary>If you are re-elected, how did you vote on previous issues? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/282">link</a>)</summary>

In a similar vein to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/256, opinions on past incidents present an important benchmark to judge candidate's moral and practical compass. This is even more important for existing SC members. SC has some out as a single front to make coordinated statements; I believe that to be an important mistake, that allows SC members to hide behind a bureaucratic body and avoid any kind of accountability. I believe it to be highly unfair. For that reason, I would like to know the historical votes of SC members on various issues.
