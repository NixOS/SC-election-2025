### Conflict of interest disclosure

None. Other than a bounty that I earned helping someone on the NixOS
Discourse with a derivation once (value approximately 100 €, IIRC), I have
never been paid for any work related to Nix, nor do I work for an employer
with a presence in the Nix community.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I love this project and I want to see it thrive. I am not concerned with
pushing the community in a direction such as ‘increasing adoption’. What I
mean by ‘thrive’ is that I want to see the energy of everyone in this
community put to its best use. Among other implications of that desire is
the notion that the superheroes of the community would be more productive
if they have someone who isn't as essential as they are in their current
positions doing the boring work to keep distractions off of their desks.
I'm ready to serve, if chosen.

#### What I have done

* Made small contributions to Nixpkgs, Nix, documentation, and
nixpkgs-update, from 2017 to the present. I'm a Nixpkgs committer and a
maintainer of a handful of packages.

* Most days, I put some time into trying to field beginner questions in
Discourse, and I use those experiences to feed into my small
contributions above.

* Served a brief (~4 months) tour on the moderation team in 2024. Before,
during, and after, generally tried to have a calming effect on
troublesome threads, or at least leave each one with a little bit better
chance for fact-based discussion and mutual understanding than I found
it. Mixed success.

* Lived for enough years to have developed a middle-aged person's sense of
time and patience, and an appreciation for the benefits of having a
variety of different ways of looking at the world at one's disposal.

#### What I will do

My abstract, metaphorical objective is to be a skeleton for the Nix
community. Without a skeleton, we are a quivering mass of brain and
muscle. To provide a structure for all that meat, an effective skeleton
must have flexible joints to allow freedom of motion, and rigid bones to
provide leverage and make the tension between opposing muscles productive.
I have little desire to tell the project where to aim; that's a brain job.
But by providing a reliable structure that bends where and when it needs
to, I hope to help transmute conflict and confusion into cooperation.

Less abstractly, here's what I'll do:

* Not assume I have the best answer to most questions. There are a lot of
smart people in this community, and ignoring their expertise is one of
the dumbest things I could do. When deferring to an existing team is a
reasonable option, it's the option I'll favor. When it isn't, either
because the existing team is obviously floundering or because there
isn't one, for non-urgent questions I will aim to ‘assemble a panel of
advisors’ (i.e., shoot off some PMs) to figure out the best thing to do,
and trust them. For questions where any answer is likely to be better
than a delay, I will try to ensure that a quick answer is chosen within
a structure that ensures that mistakes can be quickly identified and
corrected with minimal community cost. When establishing new teams fits
naturally into this process, I will push for that.

* Be personally communicative. This is a distinct goal from
‘transparency’, though it addresses many of the same problems. The goal
is to make sure you the community feel like you know what I'm doing, and
like you have the opportunity to reach out and make your voice heard
before we make big decisions. The specific implementation of that goal
is not fixed in my mind. We may publish meeting minutes. I might hold
regular office hours, or write a newsletter. I'm strongly in favor of
publishing votes, though that doesn't address the goal I mentioned (it
does serve accountability, though, which is also important). You get the
idea. Different implementations might work better for different
community members, and so I would want to pick an implementation for my
personal communications that is intentionally different from what other
SC members do, if they have similar goals. Everyone in the community
should feel comfortable talking to at least one SC representative on any
issue, and that involves considering not just with *whom* you feel
comfortable, but also *how* you feel comfortable communicating.

* Push for legible processes and policies. Legibility is an accessibility
issue. Being explicit rather than implicit makes it easier for people
from different cultures to all work together. It is also a boon for
people whose minds are structured to absorb implicit community norms
less readily. I don't mean to say that every process and policy should
be expressible at the level of program code; that would be an
undesirable extreme, as it leads to ossification, rules lawyering, and
depersonalization. But being comfortable and effective in socially
ambiguous contexts is a privilege, and we owe it to our community to
accommodate those without that privilege by documenting what we can,
when we can — and also it's cool when, sometimes, that *can* be code. (I
look forward to many spirited discussions with @philiptaron on this, if
one or both of us are selected!)

* Avoid shaking the bowl. The last few years has felt like, if you'll
indulge one more metaphor, walking down a winding hallway with an
over-full bowl of water. Each time we've turned a corner, some water has
spilled out (some people have left us). The bowl is still very full! But
losing any water is sad, and if we double-back on corners we've already
turned, we'll pay their cost in water twice. So I will aim, where
applicable, to keep us on a pre-existing trajectory when the alternative
is to cause people who have made peace with how things had been going to
decide that they need to leave now. (This doesn't mean ‘avoid solving
problems we've avoided solving in the past’! We have to move forward,
and if that means turning a corner and sloshing, we're going to slosh.
I only want to avoid paying out of both sides of the bowl for the same
corner.)


I am happy to share my opinions. You can always reach out to me by e-mail
or on Discourse and I will probably write too many words on most subjects.
But don't vote for me for my opinions. Many of them need changing, and the
struggle is knowing which ones. Vote for me if you like the way I think,
make decisions, and treat others, because none of that is changing.



## Q&A

### Should the SC vote for confidence instead of for no-confidence? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472))


The [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#full-reelections) reads:

> A simple majority within the SC may call a reelection of the entire SC based on perceived loss of confidence.

This can lead to a 3-3 deadlock as we [currently](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) [see](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/6). In this deadlock, neither the reelection, nor any majority vote can pass - the SC is unable to function.

**In many legislatures, this is flipped into a vote of confidence that must pass to avoid a re-election.** This would have the same results for a full SC, but avoid situations like the current 3-3 deadlock.

Do you support amending the constitution accordingly?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472#issuecomment-3362393533">link</a>)</summary>

I've been asked to prioritize answering this question, so here's my quick take. I may amend this later.

Spirit of the question, 100% agree. I think an amendment of some sort that is more sensitive to deadlock conditions than what we have is needed.

I have non-specific reservations — meaning, I just haven't thought about it for long enough or discussed it with anyone — about whether the exact amendment proposed presents a new avenue for abuse or is complete enough to address the root issue. (Re the first point: prior to this amendment, only a majority can force a re-roll, which suggests that re-rolls won't be abused by a coalition because a majority in agreement on other issues is already presumably getting what they want. If both sides of an argument could force a re-roll, would we see more of them? Maybe there would need to be some sort of limit on how frequently the SC can be dissolved in this way? Re the second point: what about cases when more than one member is absent or abstaining? The rest of the constitution counts majorities relative to the full body size, not those currently sitting. So not only 3-3 deadlocks, but also 3-2 or smaller deadlocks are possible. With this amendment, any resignation or incapacitation or even temporary sabbatical would bring the SC closer to losing self-confidence. Are all the second-order consequences of that desirable? I'm not yet sure. Addressing filling empty seats with more urgency might be a better thing to focus on. Re both points and my reservations: please don't take this as obstructionism. I do currently think that on the margin the proposed amendment is probably better than nothing, and I'd be likely to vote accordingly. But I think measuring twice, cutting once is the order of the day with respect to constitutional amendments. To use the framework from my candidate statement, I would triage this as a non-urgent issue and seek outside input accordingly before making a decision.)

### How would you handle an SC member joining Anduril? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190))


Recently, current SC member Tom Bereknyei took a new job at Anduril. After parts of the community [criticized](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971) the SC for not communicating this publicly, the SC gave a [statement](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/statement-on-a-steering-committee-member-joining-anduril/69007).

As an SC member, how would you like the SC to handle such a situation in the future?

*Please focus on the community aspects and be specific in what actions should be taken in such a scenario. This is not the place to discuss your opinion about the [MIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex).*

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190#issuecomment-3367274335">link</a>)</summary>

My current opinion is that the constitution's CoI rules establish a need for the SC to keep a list of employment statuses, at least for its own purposes. The current SC is doing so in public [here](https://nixos.org/community/teams/steering-committee/). I support keeping that list public and up to date. Some amount of lag is to be expected; I think less than a week's delay between change of employment status and updating the public list is within tolerance. I don't think further rules are needed, but I would probably not strongly oppose them if others on the SC believe differently, with one caveat:

Per the question-asker, this is not the place to discuss my opinion on the MIC, so I won't. What I'll say instead is that if, hypothetically, I had a strong personal belief that a particular industry or employer had a track record of acting in a way that is harmful to our community, I would encourage everyone who shared my personal belief to think really hard about whether that industry or employer benefits from getting free advertising every time it's mentioned in a formal or informal announcement, and due to my personal beliefs I would be opposed to making *more* announcements that mention it in spaces rich with potential recruiting targets (much like traditional media have started to learn that it's not a good idea to name mass shooters if they don't want copycats). I would encourage my fellow travelers to do their activism outside of official community spaces, and in particular in spaces where said industry or employer is unlikely to benefit from having its name recognition boosted. I would emphasize to them that this is *not* a general argument against any sort of activism in community spaces, but a specific exception in recognition of the practical realities of this dynamic. The best activism is the activism that doesn't make an office full of your opponents high-five each other when they see you doing it. This is just my opinion about a generic hypothetical involving our community, and not a discussion of the MIC.

### Course of action for nixos.wiki ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/474))

Unofficial spaces are outside of our jurisdiction. Just like with forks, our community's job is to offer the better product, and the SC's job is to unstick the community when it gets stuck.

### Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265))


In https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html, current SC member Gabriella argues that 7 members are too many for the SC to operate efficiently and effectively.

With the experience we made after one year: Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265#issuecomment-3370065354">link</a>)</summary>

Gabriella argues for five, and the NCA chose seven. Gabriella has the advantage of having seen the SC process actually work, from the inside. My current position is to weakly favor Gabriella's testimony over the judgment of the NCA for that reason. But one testimony doesn't compel me to action yet.

I recognize the expertise of the original NCA members and former SC members on this class of questions, and if the SC were to take up this question, I would seek and defer to their input. (If the question is taken up later in the electoral year, I would also include the expertise and input of the active SC members.)

### How would you treat SC members with completely opposite political leanings? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/489))


As the title suggests, if some SC members have completely different political affiliations and governance ideas than you, and often disagree with you on decision-making, how would you treat them? How would you ensure that you fulfill your responsibilities?

More seriously, if you find that the faction you represent is not the majority in the SC, what will you do?

### Community participant behaviour regarding moderation decisions ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/477))


**Scenario**: While being suspended by a decision from the moderation team, a suspended community participant mass mails other community participants about a community matter. The recipients did not all have an existing relationship, or a good-standing relationship with the suspended individual.

**Question**: What do you think of this behaviour? How do you characterize this in regard of the expected conduct, and the values of this community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/477#issuecomment-3393932648">link</a>)</summary>

My current opinion is that a suspension from official community spaces isn't a restraining order covering all community members. If the e-mail in and of itself (independent of the fact that the author was suspended) constitutes harassment, considered in the context of any other actions that the author has previously taken and any relationships that the author may have had with the recipients, then it should be reported to the moderation team and the mods should decide what to do with respect to the author's standing in the community, with the goal of keeping the community safe, welcoming, respectful, and on-topic. If the e-mail doesn't meet this standard, its subject matter and recipient list may still constitute ‘ban evasion’, which is again something for the mod team to consider with respect to continuing or lifting the suspension. I don't think the facts presented in the question provide enough information to make this a clear-cut example of either harassment or ban evasion.

I recognize the expertise of the moderation team on this class of questions, and they should be the first responders in such situations in any case. If a question about a decision they made were to be escalated to the SC, I would seek and defer to the input of previous moderation team members and people who have filled similar roles in other projects.

### How transparent should the SC be? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407))


In a [blog post](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html), resigned SC member @Gabriella439 recommended future SCs to increase transparency toward the community. (A different recommendation there, regarding SC size, is the subject of #265.)

In particular, the argument for this went (non-header emphasis mine):

> **Poor self-organization and internal policies/procedures**

[...]

> I think one of the big mistakes we made was that we insisted on **“speaking with one voice”**, meaning that we could not make any meaningful external statements or comments without getting majority approval from the committee (something we had difficulty with on the regular). This is why the committee remained largely silent or slow-to-respond on a large number of issues.

> This problem got bad enough that at some point many members began to break the wall of silence by commenting in an unofficial capacity on high-profile issues so that outsiders would get some visibility into what was going on instead of waiting for us to completely the slow process of gathering enough consensus and votes.

> Another internal policy that I believe was counter-productive was **not disclosing the final votes** on various issues or requiring individual signatories on public statements. Had we done this it would have likely broken a lot of internal stalemates and filibusters if all committee members were held publicly accountable for their policy positions (and therefore subject to public pressure).

> It would have also helped with another issue, which was:

> **Absenteeism**

> For various reasons (some justifiable, some not), at many points in time a large number of committee members would be unreachable, even during crucial junctures like ongoing controversy. This absenteeism was masked by the committee not publicizing that fact earlier. **If we had required all votes to be publicly recorded and all statements to require individual signatories** it would have exposed this absenteeism earlier (and led to quicker corrections).

As such, I would like to ask SC candidates: how do you regard the topic of SC transparency in light of @Gabriella439's recommendations, if not more generally? Further, how would you concretely enact these views in the SC, if elected?

### Are you in any coalitions with other candidates? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/470))


Are you aligned with other candidates in e.g. a coalition? What is your coalition about, **broadly speaking**? (Please put the finer points of your coalition's answers into other relevant questions. This question is asking for coalitions to self-identify.)

No, I have not negotiated a coalition with any other candidates. I don't think electoral coalitions are productive in an STV election.

### If mods are cops, who should decide on punishments? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464))


Related to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428 and the ongoing discussion on discourse about the resignation of the moderation team: https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828

I’ve seen different metaphors for what moderators are supposed to be. Some say moderators are like cops (enforcing rules), others say they’re like paramedics (helping people in crisis).

But no one has made the case for moderators as _judges_. If moderators are indeed tasked with enforcing rules, who then plays the role of the judiciary in our governance model? Do you think mods alone should be able to decide on the punishment (especially lifetime bans)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464#issuecomment-3393914974">link</a>)</summary>

I reject the premise. Mods in this community aren't cops, they don't enforce laws, and when they exercise power, it isn't a punishment.

Far more words about this are available in the objections section of [my answer](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428#issuecomment-3383714111) to question #428.

### What in the nix-sphere brings you joy? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/405))


This is intentionally a very open and low-stakes question. What in the nix-sphere brings you joy?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/405#issuecomment-3379149532">link</a>)</summary>

I could easily wax rhapsodic about technical merits, but that's not a very revealing response.

I'll say instead that I'm very attached to the way that the Nix community feels like a town instead of a club. Nothing against clubs, but I like that I don't know everyone here, and that I can always be surprised by new (to me) people with relevant interests and skills coming out of the woodwork to pitch in. I love how ZHF periods feel like a barn raising. It's a form of resilience, and it makes it hard for me to feel *really* pessimistic about the state of things when it looks bad. When you're only a dozen people and half of you are burnt out, that's usually game over. But in a community like ours, there's always been someone with the next good idea and the energy to run with it, and it's *not* the same dozen people over and over (though of course I see our endurance champions, and I'm immensely grateful for you!). That's very hard to foster from scratch, and that (plus our community values) is why I know I'm sticking around, through whatever differences I may have with city hall some years.

### Should community-related Conflicts of Interest be considered for the SC election? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192))


The [constitution explicitly mentions](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#conflict-of-interest-coi-balance) "employees of the same company or otherwise the same payer for Nix work" as *examples* of Conflicts of Interest for the constitution of the SC.

In the current SC, we had three members of the Nix team (Ericson2314, roberth, tomberek) and two members of the commit bit delegation team (jtojnar, winterqt), which arguably reduces diversity as well.

Should team-memberships in the community also be considered as Conflicts of Interest for the SC election? Why (not)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3367494249">link</a>)</summary>

My current opinion is no.

In the specific case of membership in another team, I think SC members should recuse themselves from votes (but not discussion) that directly concern their other teams. I think if this is done diligently and transparently there is no pressing need to restrict who is on both the SC and other teams. (Though as an aside, this would work better if recusal actually reduced the votes needed to pass a decision from the remaining members, and I do believe an amendment along those lines is needed.) If we ever find ourselves with six members from one team on the SC, that's a different story. This strikes me as unlikely to happen at present, but I would reconsider if the SC is reduced in size.

More broadly, because there have been several other proposed expansions of what constitutes a conflict of interest: I don't see the constitution's conflict of interest rules as a generic mechanism for increasing diversity on the SC (despite the wording of the constitution, which I think is misleading!). I think they are a targeted hack. From first principles, a conflict of interest arises when a member of the SC has a compelling reason to vote against the interest of the community. Everyone has the potential for a conflict between their self-interest and the interests of the community, and it's up to our consciences and the watchfulness of the electorate to keep that conflict in check, because there's not much else we can do without knowing what is in each others' hearts. Participating in a capitalist system exposes an additional powerful source for conflicts, because many of us depend on employment for our and our families' survival. This compelling dependency makes it prudent to put extra care into ensuring that a shared employer doesn't distort the action of our governing body. Additionally, an employer might benefit in ways that are not obvious to the public from decisions that don't directly concern it, so recusal is inadequate as a remedy. That's what the CoI rules address, and why it's justifiable for them to do so in such an inelegant way. If you want to convince me that they should cover something else with the same rules, convince me that the conflict introduced by that other thing is as compelling as the hold an employer has on its employees under capitalism, and that recusal is also inadequate for that thing.

Note that anything that causes the result of an election to (further) deviate from the result given by the underlying proportional method makes the result less mathematically representative of the electorate, and that's a cost that needs to be traded against any such expansions. I think the legitimacy that derives from a proportionally representative SC is very valuable.

(Should we have other, less heavy-handed rules that promote other forms of diversity? I'm sympathetic to the idea. In practice, a seven-member body is going to be limited in the number of forms of diversity it can meaningfully support, so anything we can codify here would be an imperfect compromise. I would be inclined to see a few more elections play out before trying to decide if an imperfect intervention would be worth it, and which forms of diversity to prioritize if so.)

I recognize the expertise of the original NCA members and former SC members on this class of questions, and if the SC were faced with a related decision I would seek and defer to their input. (Meaning: all of that stuff I wrote is only my initial opinion, and I don't cling to it, though I share it because it may bias me and you deserve to know my biases. It's likely to change after I've talked to actual experts instead of just giving my first armchair-philosopher take. This applies to all of my responses to which I append this form of statement.)

### What is the goal of community moderation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428))


What, in your opinion, is the goal of community moderation?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428#issuecomment-3383714111">link</a>)</summary>

A topic close to my heart, and one on which I'm more comfortable assigning weight to my own opinions, having spent some time on the moderation team.

The formulation I would use, when putting together a moderation team from scratch, is that moderators should seek to make community spaces safe, welcoming, respectful, and on-topic, in roughly that order, via any social and technical means consistent with our values.

I don't expect our moderators to be enforcers, or judges, or punishers, or any concept borrowed from legal or justice systems. If you want to emulate criminal law, bring me a proposal that also introduces democratic legislative processes, jury trials, public defenders, courts of appeal, checks and balances, a robust fourth estate, and the rest of the machinery that attempts to make justice systems not actually travesties of justice (and still often doesn't succeed at the attempt!). In the absence of all that — and to be absolutely clear, our community does not have the capacity to support all of that — criminal law is a dangerous model that doesn't serve the goal of making community spaces safe, welcoming, etc. It encourages a depersonalizing approach — ‘sorry, it's the law’ — over the nuanced resolutions that prevent lasting damage. It may keep the peace, but it's an oppressive, skin-deep peace that favors the powerful and fails to protect the powerless.

<details>
<summary>Some anticipated objections (I hope you like text)</summary>

* *Doesn't the moderation team* enforce *the Code of Conduct?*

  In some communities, this is the model used. A corporate moderation team such as you might find working at Microsoft or Meta probably adheres to this model. There is a written standard of behavior, and a pool of fungible labor that is only trusted to adjudicate complaints against that standard of behavior. The result is, well, the kind of protection you get on GitHub or Facebook. That might be sufficient for you, dear reader, and honestly it's usually tolerable for me as well. But for many members of our community it isn't, which is why I support a different model. In my preferred model, the Code of Conduct is not a criminal code upstream of the moderators. It is an advertisement made by the moderation team itself about what it expects from the community and how it intends to moderate. It's important to have a CoC because prospective community members deserve to know what they're in for if they start participating here, just like it's important for me and other candidates to answer these questions because you deserve to know what you're in for if you elect us. And for the same reason, it's important for the CoC to be honest and not misleading. But complaints that, for example, the CoC is ‘unevenly enforced’ are fundamental misunderstandings of the model. The CoC doesn't take responsibility for keeping people safe; the moderators do. The CoC doesn't evaluate the situation and determine the course of action most likely to lead to a safe, welcoming, etc. environment; the moderators do. And the moderators should not be dissuaded from de-escalating one situation diplomatically — a great achievement! — if they had to resort to a suspension to de-escalate a different but similar-looking situation.

  Because of the prevalence of corporate-style moderation teams, I don't fault anyone for entering the conversation believing that our moderation team and our CoC should follow that model. But as a point of fact, historically our community has followed the second model, for as long as we've formally recognized moderation as a distinct responsibility worthy of a team. The text of the CoC was selected by the moderation team. The moderation team has been responsible for customizing it to suit the needs of our community. And importantly, our community has aggregated the sort of people who are comfortable with personal, diplomatic, empathetic moderators, not fungible law enforcers. We've lost some of those people in recent years but many remain. Our community values clearly point toward continuing to welcome and support them with the style of moderation they've come to expect over the years. Feel free to start your own community with blackjack and corporate-style moderation any time you want, or join one of the ones out there to your liking. You'll still be welcome here for as long as you don't make trouble for our mods.

* *Isn't a ban a punishment?*

  I know it can feel like one. But suspensions don't carry a value judgment with them. Nobody tried you and found you guilty of anything. We don't ban ‘bad people’. We don't suspend people to get back at them for wronging the community, or to deter others from doing the same. (Think: if retribution or deterrence were goals, the mod team would be louder about suspensions, wouldn't it?) A suspension is nothing more than a de-escalation tool of last resort. Sometimes, good people need some time to cool down before they can be expected to contribute to the community conversation in a way consistent with the moderation team's goals. Sometimes, people demonstrate over time that they are unwilling or unable to make the personal behavior changes needed for a long-term relationship with us, and we have to break up. Getting dumped never feels good, but thinking about it as a punishment is all wrong.

* *Okay, but isn't sentencing someone to a suspension the act of a judge?*

  I'll admit there's some overlap, in that both a good moderator and a good judge will take the well-being of the community and any mitigating circumstances into account when deciding on a course of action. But again, a suspension is not a sentence, for all of the above reasons. A judge operates within, and is constrained by, a legalistic framework. A judge can't be expected to know the parties involved in a dispute and therefore has to be impartial as an approximation of justice. A moderator *is* expected to know the parties involved, if they're community regulars, and to take the course of action most likely to produce a safe, welcoming, etc. environment. Blinding oneself to the ways in which different people are different, think differently, and react differently obstructs that goal and isn't part of my expectation for moderators. Judges have an easier job!

* *Suppose I am willing to concede that judge-like impartiality isn't desirable for moderators. Isn't it still the case that we want moderators not to show* favoritism *towards people they like? And then how are you know to know if the mod team has a favoritism problem if it is business as usual for them not to treat people like they are all the same person?*

  Yes, it is absolutely the case that we want moderators not to show favoritism. (Even the moderators want this. Favoritism leads to the moderators not having the trust of the community. Without the trust of the community, moderators have fewer social means at their disposal to achieve their goal, making them less effective and less happy.) And yes, it's hard to demonstrate that favoritism isn't in effect in the model where moderators are given autonomy over how they resolve issues in the community. But corporate-style, rule-enforcing, fungible moderation only seems to have an advantage here because it aims lower. Compromising several of our sub-goals just because one of them is challenging isn't rational.

  I think there are ways we could augment the moderation team with some oversight processes that would be beneficial, both to the community at large and to the moderation team's quality of life. Mark my logical quantifier carefully — I am *not* saying that *any* proposal for imposing oversight on the moderation team would be beneficial. Many would not be, and I would not attempt to impose an oversight process on the moderation team without their consent. But I believe one could be co-developed, with the team, to which they would consent and which would improve our protection against favoritism. The reason I think this derives from my experience on the team — it consumes extra time to debate what is best to do about a tricky social situation when you know that you're going to have the final word on the subject. It is important to be fair and principled, and it is also important to be responsive and to act quickly when conflicts are escalating, and those things are in tension with each other. It would have been a relief in some ways to know that there was an appeal process or an audit or something that would allow us to revisit and reverse any mistakes we make in the heat of the moment, and a boon to have an additional trusted perspective that isn't biased by our initial reaction on the ground. The trick is to design such a thing without actually relocating the responsibility for these decisions to another body, and without burdening the mod team more than it liberates it. My overall point, though, is that we *can* address fears of favoritism without replacing the entire moderation model with cops and laws.

  (Such a thing would not be a failsafe against having fundamentally bad mods. The failsafe against fundamentally bad mods — when they are judged so with appropriate epistemic humility, and not based on a hunch or grudge plus loads of confirmation bias — is the SC. The failsafe against SC members with poor judgment is the electorate. Noble people can subvert corrupt processes, but noble processes can't save corrupt people.)

### How would you act on the moderation team's call to SC candidates? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/390))


When a large part of the moderation team [stepped down](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828) they asked for:

> **We call on the SC candidates:** to commit to implementing a Constitution reform that will require transparency and accountability from the SC, with teams like technical steering and moderation providing a counterbalance.

How would you act as a member of the next SC in this matter?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/390#issuecomment-3379101794">link</a>)</summary>

My current opinion is that this is a failure of people, not process. The constitution already establishes that the SC should (emphasis mine) ‘**[d]elegate authority** to long-term teams and committees, **allowing them to evolve policies** as needed.’ The SC's power, also in the constitution, to ‘revoke delegation of a specific part of authority’ doesn't negate the responsibility to delegate under ordinary circumstances. If the SC chooses to disregard this part of the constitution, they can disregard or argue out of other parts as well. Ultimately, there is no substitute for electing trustworthy leaders with the humility to question their own judgment and expertise, and to not only listen to but *defer* to teams with more hands-on experience than they have, instead of escalating disagreements into conflicts. If we fail at that, I don't think any constitutional reform can save us. *This is more important than any object-level issue about who gives us money or who hosts our software. The electorate will get the governance we ask for, in the end, and that will determine everything else about the fate of this project.*

In our project, I don't think the moderation team is special with respect to how the SC ought to interact with it. The Rust project offers an interesting alternative model, with their moderation team given an extraordinary last-resort power to prevent overreach, but I would be just as dissatisfied with the leadership provided by the sitting SC if they had intervened to this degree, with this little apparent justification or respect, in any other team.

If this continues to be a flash point, that could be evidence that we should consider a model in which the mod team *is* special. The SC snatched defeat from the jaws of victory this year, but it's still only been one electoral year, and it's not yet obvious to me that we need a technical patch rather than a social culture change.

But more important than my opinions about the need for a patch is this: I want the mod team (like every team) to feel supported and trusted by the SC. I want to create conditions such that the previous moderators are comfortable coming back, and if that isn't possible I want new moderators who share the goals of the previous moderation team (avoid shaking the bowl!) and who are trusted by the community (because they can't do their job otherwise — moderators are not an occupying force), and I want *them* to feel supported and trusted by the SC as well. If that means unprincipled hacks in the constitution, I'm open to it — I'm a programmer; I've done worse.

### Stance on specific case of statements made by external actors ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/485))


The following was authored by @jaen but I'm posting it on their behalf because they cannot and I would like answers to it as well. The title of the issue was written by me.

---

The recent SC turmoil had been commented on outside the community in various venues. In particular, I'd like to draw attention to this [Twitter thread](https://xcancel.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1972037286192992320) where certain individuals talk about _“get[ting] these nut jobs out”_ and that _“[M]aybe @<!-- -->PalmerLuckey can help turn the ship around.”_ While the Anduril founder does not acknowledge those proposals directly, he says this:

> The good news is that Anduril will keep using Nix to build ever more powerful weapons for American dominance regardless of what the fringe "community" people say.

The question is, what is your stance on this thread — is it a nothingburger, or an indication of existential threat to community governance and self-sovereignity — and what steps, if any, do you plan to take to insulate the project against the threat, should it it materialise into something more concrete than online bickering.

And as a corollary to that, what does Nix governance and self-sovereignity means for you, do you feel it’s an important aspect for the SC to work towards and what would your be general policy to handle potential threats stemming from external actors looking to control the project to their own ends. Consider what limits — if any — you would seek to put on such a threat actor, how — if at all — could that extend to functions community members associated with them could perform at a maintainer and/or governance levels, for example to ensure the threat actor cannot pressure them into acting against the project's best interests.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/485#issuecomment-3393965429">link</a>)</summary>

Anduril likes to troll. That's what this looks like to me, right now. I'm sure if he had a ‘take over Nix’ button, Luckey would push it for the lulz. I don't see any evidence that he's anywhere near the realization of such a plan.

The bottom line is that Nix projects should not be controlled by *any* corporation, whether or not they give advance notice of their intent. The first line of defense against such an outcome is the people doing the work. Teams, make sure you aren't taken over by a corporation. Electorate, make sure you elect people you trust not to give the projects to a corporation. That's really all there is to say on the matter.

### What should happen in the event of an SC member resigning early? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481))


The SC is currently elected by proportional representation, which seeks to reflect the preferences of its voters.
However, over this initial SC term we have seen multiple early resignations, potentially making what remains of the SC less representative of its voter base, if not also affecting [decision-making capabilities](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/some-procedural-clarifications-on-the-constitution/70278).

Now, there may be alternate ways to deal with scenarios involving early retirement, including going over the original votes to recalculate what alternate candidate might best represent this part of the electorate, or (eventually) even calling new elections.

As a candidate to the body in charge of our constitution, how would you ideally see these cases handled?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481#issuecomment-3393943094">link</a>)</summary>

I think holding a special election is the best answer we have right now, despite its potential for distorting proportionality for the remainder of the term. (Try not to resign early without a full re-election if you think you hold more minority views, I guess?)

In the long run... voting theory is hard. I would certainly entertain alternate proposals for how to deal with such circumstances.

I recognize the expertise of the original NCA members on this class of questions, and if the SC were to start working on a constitutional amendment targeting their case I would definitely seek their input, though in this case probably not defer to it exclusively — I'd want to find and triangulate with some outside experts too.

### How should the SC communicate with the community? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199))


The [list of official announcements](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/announcements/steering-committee/57) from the first year of SC starts with two general updates in November and December 24, then continues with only specific announcement on certain topics. Even if a bit delayed, the Foundation has given [more updates](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/meta/nixos-foundation/47).

Arguably there was not much insight for the community into what the SC was working on.

How would an SC with you as a member, communicate with the community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199#issuecomment-3370043605">link</a>)</summary>

I want to separate out communicativity and transparency as two related but distinct goals.

Being more communicative is about letting you, the electorate, know what your representatives have on their minds. This is a cultural change, one that each SC member can pursue individually. I think that this is important but, as I described in my candidate statement, I don't have a specific mode of communication chosen yet. I'll figure it out on the fly, if selected.

Transparency is about making the official and collective actions of the SC public, to increase accountability and trust. Making votes public as a general rule is absolutely something worth doing, and I think this has fairly wide support at this point, so it shouldn't be difficult to agree to do this. Beyond that, publishing minutes, or alternating between meetings being open and closed to public spectators (I'm not drawn to the idea of having a special observer group, just because they'll inevitably be accused of being part of the same leadership clique when trust is low), both strike me as things worth considering but not entirely cost-free. In particular, we've already seen what happens when the SC fails to gel as a unit, and I think it's even harder to develop feelings of empathy and mutual support when all of your interactions with each other are on stage, so to speak. We should seek a good balance. But directionally, I absolutely agree that we should be moving toward more transparency.

### Would you join in an Election Integrity Pledge? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/488))


Everybody running feels strongly about serving the Nix community by running for election, but we also know that not all of us are going to get elected.

I'd like to ask if my colleagues would join me in publicly declaring their belief in an orderly and peaceful election and governance process. *Even if not elected, all of us can serve the community by setting a good example of behavior and decorum!*


### The Election Integrity Pledge:

>As a candidate for the Steering Committee, in order to demonstrate a good community spirit and trust, I hereby pledge that henceforth...
>
>* ...I believe that as a community we are here to do our best work and to ship code.
>* ...I support and celebrate the democratic nature of our elections.
> * ...if elected, I will dutifully and in good-faith participate in all SC work for as long as I have a seat.
> * ...elected or not, I will support the SC and the governance processes, and refrain from slandering or libeling SC members or candidates, or misrepresenting SC actions in public spaces.
> * ...I will not participate in, encourage, or aid public pressure campaigns against the SC, its members, or its candidates.
> * ...I will act with integrity and honor in the discharge of my duties.


If you agree, please reply simply with:

> I sign and support the Election Integrity Pledge.

Thank you.

@tomberek nailed it: we have a document that describes what we're here to do, to the extent that we all agree on it.

> * ...I support and celebrate the democratic nature of our elections.

I certainly do! Fair elections are what separate a representative democracy from an oligarchy. It's a wonderful thing to be able to poll the electorate and arrive at a body that represents them fairly and proportionally; so much better than merely extrapolating what the full electorate might want from the smaller number of people speaking up. That is precisely why I recently lent my support to a petition to the SC to have a full election this term. All upside, no downside — to people who truly celebrate the democratic nature of our elections, of course!

> * ...if elected, I will dutifully and in good-faith participate in all SC work for as long as I have a seat.

So help me, I will — at the pleasure of the electorate, who are the SC's boss.

> * ...elected or not, I will support the SC and the governance processes, and refrain from slandering or libeling SC members or candidates, or misrepresenting SC actions in public spaces.

I can easily agree to this, given good-faith (dare I say... boring?) interpretations of the words ‘support’, ‘slander’, ‘libel’, and ‘misrepresent’, though I note that each of these words seem likely to be used in a rather looser manner than I'd prefer by someone with an axe to grind. I reserve the right to criticize with honesty and integrity.

> * ...I will not participate in, encourage, or aid public pressure campaigns against the SC, its members, or its candidates.

Well. What an interesting thing to include in this pledge.

Reading between the lines, the implication seems to be that something has happened recently that the question-asker thinks constitutes a ‘pressure campaign’. And I'm at a loss to identify what that could be. Are leaks of internal discussions a ‘pressure campaign’? Is public criticism of the conduct of elected officials a ‘pressure campaign’? Is a signed petition to elected officials requesting — *demanding*, even — that they vote a certain way on a given issue a ‘pressure campaign’? No to all of these, surely! All of these are instances of the democratic process working, if not as it *should*, at least as well as it can in times of controversy. Responsible leaks *can be* an essential safeguard against wrong-doing (how much evidence they *actually are* of such can be a matter of debate). Being free to publicly criticize elected leaders is a central right in democracies, and woe befalls the society that loses it. Organizing popular support for an issue, and communicating the result of that organization to representatives, is one of the few ways that representatives have of learning what *the people they represent* want in aggregate. Painting *any* of these things as mean old ‘pressure campaigns’ leaves me with a very poor impression of how much *you* celebrate democracy (not to mention how you use words, per my concern about your previous bullet)!

So no, if you're asking whether I will join you in considering the conduct of my representatives only when they are up for re-election and blithely letting them do whatever they want the rest of the time, I certainly will not. That is a dereliction of the duty that this entire electorate has to *actually* support the mission of the SC and hold its members accountable.

> * ...I will act with integrity and honor in the discharge of my duties.

Always. But don't just take my word for it. Hold me to it. I've tried to be very clear about this: *I don't want this job if I don't have your trust.* That means, if elected, I want to know if I lose it. And if I can't fix the problem, the next best thing I can do for the project is give the job to someone who can.

If we, collectively, can put five people on the SC this year who all believe in the above ethos, I *genuinely don't care* if I'm one of them. I'd slightly prefer *not* to be, if I'm being perfectly honest. Just vote for people who want to *represent* you and be your *public servant*, not just take your vote and then be the person who knows best about things for two years.

### politics of tech and governing values ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487))


Whereas the existing Nix projects have licenses already, one popular adage states technology is not neutral - perhaps increasingly obviously so, as the impact of technology continues to grow.

As such, zooming out a bit, one of the topics the community has seen different takes on seems whether we should govern by certain values, as exemplified by actions such as the earlier open letter against MIC sponsorships, a sentiment that seemed represented among contributors, or 'keep politics out', a sentiment that has seemed represented more at e.g. the NixOS sub-reddit.

As a candidate, where do you stand on this? What values should we expect you to hold?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487#issuecomment-3393997746">link</a>)</summary>

I don't think ‘keep politics out’ is an internally consistent viewpoint for a free software project, so clearly I don't support it. (Seems like this is a case in which the words mean something other than their literal meaning for the people who find this an inspiring slogan. I've yet to learn what that hidden meaning is; maybe someday I'll figure it out, or have it adequately explained to me.)

I do value pluralism, including, to an extent, political pluralism. I think that pluralism is the ideology that the Nix community chose in the constitutional discussions, to answer the comment that occasionally arises to the effect of, ‘The Nix community should just choose an ideology and everyone can either get with the program or leave.’ Pluralism presents challenges, particularly in a global community. More cultures means more ways for people to give and take offense. We live in times when many people's nerves are frayed from the political conflicts that social media companies have amplified in service of ever-growing engagement metrics. We need patience and grace, and yet many of us have precious little of both to offer. Don't believe anyone who tells you it's simple, and that you ‘just’ need to do this or understand that. (Not even me, if you catch me doing it.) It's a struggle. We need more trust so badly, and yet if we offer each other our trust openly, those with the least scruples will get their way. Take small steps towards that which is strange to you. Create as much distance as you need to protect yourself. Surrender your ego. Build things together. Find ways to move past that on which you disagree. Practice ‘reading the room’. Ask for advice. Never forget the value of another human. Nourish love.

All of that I just said? That's a political statement. I'm not in favor of keeping that out of tech in general, or of the Nix community in particular. From our published community values and the structure of our constitution, those are the politics that I think follow naturally and essentially. That's the program. I hope as many of you as are able will get with it.

### Who are "The Nix Community", and why? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/436))


One outcome of the NCA was the "Constitution", which advertises "Values". It falls short, however, of "constituting a community": it does not attempt to describe anything resembling a "membership predicate", a matter that was intensively discussed in the Governance Zulip. I'm interested in the candidates' reasoning and reflection about the community's composition, but here's also a few litmus tests:

- Are DetSys and Anduril "part of the community"?
- Is Jon Ringer "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Is srid "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Generally, how does moderation action affect "community membership"?
- Are former maintainers, who resigned in support of either of the two Open Letters, "part of the community"?
  - If they have not contributed back to the project since?
  - If they participate in discussions on Discourse or in Social Media?
  - If they contribute only to forks?
  - If they contribute to forks, but backport ad hoc?
- Are Lix, Snix, the Foundation, or the nix-community "part of the community"?
- Are NixCon Sponsors "part of the community"?
- Of participants of Nix-Offtopic and Discourse, are those, who do not "contribute" code, documentation, or decision-making, still "part of the community"?

Finally,

- Are people who disagree with the composition or the priorities of the "Values" part of the community?

To me, it's a bit odd to ask this outside of the context of a particular use of the phrase (despite generally being a lover of pedantry and definition-wrangling!). My personal interpretation of the phrase as it is used in the constitution, and probably in most of the general (lowercase-D) discourse, is something along the lines of the following:

* People who use any of the products or services that the organization provides (including, e.g., communication services like our uppercase-D Discourse),
* who self-identify as part of the community,
* and who have not been formally removed from the community.

But for a more precise conversation, use a more precise term, or define it yourself.

### How are you going to interact with Lix? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/283))


Lix is now a major part of the ecosystem, providing a non-commercial, production-ready alternative to Nix. It falls outside of governance power of SC, but coordination with it is of paramount importance for Nix development, security patching, and stability of Nixpkgs (as there have been numerous occasions where Lix has fixed a crucial bug that was preventing Nixpkgs work, while Nix hasn't). Historically, there has been hostility towards Lix and running it on NixOS Community infra.

How do you plan to structure your communication with Lix Project?

I consider this question to be the responsibility of the relevant teams. The Nix team, for decisions about code, features, standardization, etc.; the infra team, for decisions about our infra and what it runs; the Nixpkgs core team, for decisions about what Nixpkgs supports; and so forth. I would form opinions on cross-team concerns or conflicts on a case-by-case basis.

### How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197))


There is an [ongoing](https://discourse.nixos.org/search?q=Determinate%20Nix%20%23links%20in%3Atitle%20order%3Alatest) conflict between Determinate Systems and parts of the community. Some aspects of this, such as the "Nix the trademark" are likely things for the [foundation](https://github.com/nixos/foundation) to deal with.

However, Determinate Systems is *part of the community* as well, so this conflict also has aspects internal to the Nix community.

How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197#issuecomment-3369984456">link</a>)</summary>

To be honest, I see a lot more smoke than fire in this conflict. As just some person in the community, I've spent a small amount of time probing the arguments to see if I can understand them better. It hasn't gone particularly well, and I'm a little dissatisfied with that, but it hasn't been worth it to press — the people making the anti-DetSys case are understandably wary of people who might be arguing in bad faith, and the risk/reward ratio of ‘look like a stooge’/‘learn more about the issue but not have the power to do much about it’ was too high.

If I'm selected for the SC, you should know that this may be a blind spot for me. But if you are on the anti-DetSys side and you have the patience to drill into the details of the objections and establish some common principles for what is acceptable competitive behavior and what isn't, that's a conversation I would very much like to have with you, and I'll do my best to be open-minded and respectful of your time.

### What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to community and Foundation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337))


(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/34 from 2024 election)

What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to the community? Should they be linked on the homepage? If so, should they be compelled to comply with the Foundation's code of conduct? Should we attempt to convert these communities into official spaces (if so, at what point)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337#issuecomment-3378815154">link</a>)</summary>

We shouldn't try to be the world Nix police. No ‘sanctions’ should be imposed on unofficial spaces. (But when making decisions about *our own* spaces, we are under no obligation to pretend that the actions people take outside of our official spaces have no impact or aren't indicative of what the actor is like.)

Linking to unofficial spaces constitutes an endorsement, and we should take into account what we're endorsing when choosing to do so, and make endorsements in a way that is consistent with our community values.

We should also consider our community values, both social and technical, when considering adopting (with consent!) an unofficial community. In particular, in light of our community value of free/libre software, we should not increase our proprietary software and service footprint.

(This is all necessarily abstract because I haven't personally spent any significant time in unofficial community spaces, and am therefore unqualified to make a specific call about any of them at this time.)

I recognize the expertise of the moderation team on questions related to personal conduct, and if the SC were faced with a decision related to conduct in an unofficial space, I would seek and defer to their input.

### How can contributing to Nix-the-implementation be made easier? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196))


It has repeatedly been mentioned in the past, that contributing to [Nix](https://github.com/nixos/nix) is hard.

What are the reasons for this from your perspective and how can this be improved?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196#issuecomment-3367542785">link</a>)</summary>

I consider this question to be the responsibility of the Nix team. They are best placed to understand the costs and benefits of various approaches and reforms relative to the status quo. I am happy for the SC to support them the same way it would support any other official team, which includes securing resources and helping to coordinate with other teams to, say, get recruiting messages out. But I believe that delegating authority to official teams, as the constitution says we must, means letting them take the initiative on tackling their own challenges without intervention from above outside of extraordinary circumstances (gross misconduct, irreconcilable conflicts, objective catastrophic failure, that sort of thing).

I encourage anyone who has an interest in this issue, including my fellow candidates, to reach out to the Nix team to get their thoughts, offer suggestions, and find out if there's anything they can do to help.

### Should electoral alliances/coalitions count as conflicts of interest? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/479))


Related to #470.

It has been brought to my attention that several candidates are interested in forming electoral coalitions[^1] where candidates agree to vote for each other in time for the election. This could significantly change the result of the election, especially if coalitions decide to formalize which candidates they choose to vote for and which they do not, and if many members of the same coalition are elected to office, their shared interests could dominate the SC. In spite of this, there are currently no rules in place that will require electoral coalition/alliance status to be disclosed in each candidate's statement. 

Do you think participation in coalitions and alliances *has to be* disclosed? If not, do you think they *should* be disclosed?

[^1]: To be clear, *informal* alignments such as friendships do not count here — whether *those* should be counted as CoIs deserve a different issue altogether.

I take a very limited view of what constitutes a conflict of interest (see [my answer](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3367494249) to #192), and I don't currently see any reason why this should count as one.

Of course all candidates ought to be honest and forthcoming about the kind of leadership they aspire to provide, including, if applicable, things they've agreed to compromise in favor of coalition goals. But it'd be difficult to enforce that as a requirement even if such a thing is desirable. That's why it's so vital to elect representatives worthy of your trust.

### How are you planning to reconcile conflicts between SC and Nix team? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/285))


Nix is a central piece of the ecosystem, and Nix team holds authority over it. Additionally, many Nix team members are a long-time, trusted community members, making them overwhelmingly more likely to be elected. One of the purposes of SC is to coordinate different teams; this poses a clear conflict of interest, when someone is in both Nix team and SC, as that person's interests as an SC member and Nix team member are not necessarily aligned.

How is such a conflict of interest planned to be addressed, or resolved?

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/285#issuecomment-3370102746">link</a>)</summary>

The SC supports and delegates to teams. I welcome Nix team members on the SC and don't see this as a conflict of interest, because both the Nix team and the SC have the goal of service to the community. If anyone is somehow found not to have the goal of service to the community, they belong in neither body. Same goes for any other team.

<summary>Should Nix transition away from GitHub to a self-hosted git forge? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/326">link</a>)</summary>

(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/18 from the 2024 election)

Do you believe Nix should move away from GitHub and instead host its independent Git forge? If so, what are the benefits and challenges of such a transition, and how would you approach this shift if it were to happen?

If you already answered last year, it would probably totally be fine to just copy that answer.

<summary>Voter mechanisms to recall individual candidates (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482">link</a>)</summary>

Over the past days, there have been [multiple](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971/) [calls](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/) for individual SC candidates to step down, or even calling for a [full reelection](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/).

Current procedures have yet to take into account such desires, meaning we would currently depend on either:

- SC members voting one another out (re: individual SC members)
- SC votes of no confidence (c.f. #472)

Would you rather see such a formal mechanism to retroactively retract/amend votes or recall individual delegates? If yes, what should this look like? If not, why not?

<summary>How do you want to proceed with sponsorship policy? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/342">link</a>)</summary>

Last year, one of the most important questions to people running for SC was sponsorship policy, in particular regarding MIC companies. Since then, there were some efforts on the SC side to draft a comprehensive sponsorship policy, and they also started approving/denying sponsors directly, without delegation to NixCon team.

Do you feel like SC taking on this job is adequate in the long run, or do you see it as a temporary measure? What are your next steps on pursuing a sponsorship policy?

<summary>How should the SC deal with people in the org chart not respecting their authority? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/491">link</a>)</summary>

This question is based on a question from the previous year: https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114
> **Title: What's the best way for the steering committee to deal with inaction or being ignored?**
> One of the main ways in which the previous Nix governance has been criticized is for ignoring or being inactive in the face of community protests and concerns.[1](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#user-content-fn-1-be51383cd9081764e2d5d66461ad8100)
> 
> Let's suppose that the steering committee is now responsive to the community... but when the steering committee asks for or directs action, that request is ignored, de-prioritized, or litigated by the relevant parties.
> 
> How would you as a single SC member deal with this? How would you ask for your fellow steering committee members to act as a group?

> [1]: I'm not interested in rehashing or re-litigating these specific cases or people involved; please do not do so in your answer. [↩](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#user-content-fnref-1-be51383cd9081764e2d5d66461ad8100)

I would like to specifically add that the party in question might escalate the matter into the court of public opinion.

In the answers from the previous year there was a very clear dividing line among candidates about not only using explicit powers granted by the constitution, versus using activism.

Would you advocate for the SC using activism proactively?
Would you advocate for the SC using activism once a matter is moved into the court of public opinion?
How do you think the SC should react to activism?
At what point should the SC concede to activist pressures?

Adding to that footnote, I also don't mean to say this is hat happened recently or want to litigate specific recent events, I'm interested in other candidates general view on these kinds of issues.

<summary>How are you going to resolve S3 cache situation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/336">link</a>)</summary>

S3 cache size continues to rise. AWS still pays the bills for it, but this part of infra is something that might need a look.

Latest updates on the topic that I could find were from about a year ago on the Discourse:

https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-06-06-re-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-6/46617
https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-07-10-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-7/48821

My understanding is that it's a complicated topic, where a lot of technical decisions need to be made, and Foundation needs to get a lot of talks with various potential partners, and this needs to be coordinated. Binary cache is a center piece of the infra, so its future needs to be well-secured; do you have any concrete steps in mind on how to proceed? Maybe coordinating with someone doing software archiving?

<summary>How are you planning to pursue a trademark? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/340">link</a>)</summary>

A trademark is direly needed, as there are many commercial projects who use "Nix" in their name for marketing purposes, sometimes confusingly. However, the trademark rules have to be reasonable for downstream users, and put clear guidelines. Furthermore, there might be conflicts if the trademark policy doesn't match a company's path. Additionally, it will require a clear set of guidelines between what each of Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS project constitutes, and how much "Nix" they share (possibly with renaming?)

How do you plan to handle this?

<summary>If you were in a previous SC, how would you vote on public issues? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/281">link</a>)</summary>

There were several decisions made by previous SC in response to community conflicts. They set an important benchmark to gauge candidate's decision-making. Those questions are:

    Allow Anduril to keep publishing jobs on Discourse?
    Replace PolyMC with Prism Launcher?
    What should be the policy on MIC participation?
    What should be the policy for telemetry?

What additional initiatives would you raise?

<summary>How do you want to structure communication with Determinate Systems? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/341">link</a>)</summary>

The title might seem excessively direct. However, last year, there was a question on MIC policy and Anduril ban. Since then, SC has enforced a ban on Anduril job posting. Anduril has been a very controversial company for the wide community; I feel like it's fitting to ask about another controversial company, and how to interact with it.

What are the problems you see with communication between Determinate Systems and NixOS Community? Are there concrete suggestions you have, or would like to propose? What other areas of work (Nix improvements, trademark policy, etc.) do you feel prevent healthy collaboration?

<summary>What are your thoughts on documentation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/339">link</a>)</summary>

Documentation is often cited as being lackluster, incomplete, or confusing. Personally, I disagree; I've seen many improvements to documentation over the years, and I think it has come a long way. Still, those improvements don't address the core issue for why documentation *feels* lackluster.

IMO, the issue is because the boundaries between projects are not clear. A new NixOS user will look at the NixOS manual for help: but really, they are using Nix+Nixpkgs+NixOS stack. For a beginner, it is not clear why there would be three manuals, and where the boundaries lie, and which manual they need (especially when interacting with a layering violation). This provides a frustrating experience, where despite the information being abundant, it is not at all discoverable in a relevant fashion.

Is this something that you are concerned with? What do you want to do with it? Direct more resources into cross-cutting documentation projects, like nix.dev or wiki.nixos.org ? Work on clearer project boundaries? Attempt to bridge documentation?

I am curious to hear your thoughts.

<summary>What is your view on licensing? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/338">link</a>)</summary>

Right now, the ecosystem is very split between permissive licenses (MIT), copyleft-ish licenses (LGLP, MPL), and copyleft licenses (GPL). This signifies a wider disagreement between people on what community is, and what to expect.

Licenses are by no means perfect, but they signify intention and direction. They are like a COC: adopting one doesn't instantly solve all of your problems (nor is expected to), but it shows where the project is heading. This has a lot of consequences later down the line. It could be argued that Nixpkgs being MIT-licensed is a reason why there are so many companies hanging around it; it could likewise be argued that the reason DetSys hasn't been more successful with their "downstream distribution" has to do with LGPL.

What is your view on licensing? Are you planning to put out guidelines for licensing official and community projects? Pursue relicensing various projects?

<summary>How are you going to reform SC? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/284">link</a>)</summary>

To me, SC results were disappointing. Despite the community having clearly cast their votes, not much of substance was achieved in a year. This is indicative of a "committee" situation: where consensus is required to make any decisions. This poses an existential threat to the effectiveness of SC, as SC is meant to represent very diverse parts of the community, that often have conflicting interests. Achieving consensus in such a case is a pipe dream.

That's why SC members need a lot more autonomy, to be able to make decisions on their own (overriden by majority, if significant opposition arises) and not get blocked by achieving impossible consensus. This is the entire purpose of SC, as consensus-driven decisions were made with RFCs, and ran into all the same issues.

Considering this, how would you reform the SC to allow for more individual action and autonomy?

<summary>What is a "competing implementation", and should being involved in one constitute a conflict of interest? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/456">link</a>)</summary>

(This is a little targeted, though everyone is welcome to chime in with their thoughts, of course.)

In https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3354754312 you said that you're worried about the current definition of "conflict of interest" not including "being involved in competing implementations and communities, social media groups, country, military status, and so forth".

What is a "competing implementation" or "competing community" to you? What level of involvement would you consider significant enough to constitute CoI? What decisions are you expecting the SC to make where this CoI becomes an issue?

Also, once again, as a litmus test, would any of these people be considered to have a CoI?
- a Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc team member
- a Determinate Systems employee
- a Snix/Tvix/Lix/etc contributor
- a contibutor to both NixOS/nix and Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc
- a person present in Tvix/Snix/Lix/etc discussion spaces
- an Auxolotl/Ekala/etc contributor
- a contributor to both NixOS/nixpkgs and Ekala/Auxolotl/etc
- a person present in Auxolotl/Ekala/etc discussion spaces

Also, can you maybe name examples of social media groups or countries that would be considered to have a CoI, and why/when?

<summary>Currently sitting SC members running for reelection: why did you vote the way you did on a vote of no confidence on 2025-09-30? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/452">link</a>)</summary>

Today, [a reply by @jtojnar](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) on the whistleblowing post mentioned that the Steering Committee held a vote of no confidence today, 30 September 2025.

> Vote of no confidence of the entire SC 2025-09-30 (failed 3/6)

A "yes" vote to a vote of no confidence implies that the individual does not have trust in the SC. A "no" vote implies that there is still some trust left.

Why did you vote the way that you did?

In a similar vein to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/256, opinions on past incidents present an important benchmark to judge candidate's moral and practical compass. This is even more important for existing SC members. SC has some out as a single front to make coordinated statements; I believe that to be an important mistake, that allows SC members to hide behind a bureaucratic body and avoid any kind of accountability. I believe it to be highly unfair. For that reason, I would like to know the historical votes of SC members on various issues.
