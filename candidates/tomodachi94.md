## Conflict of interest disclosure

My employer is unrelated to Nix. I am a moderator on the NixOS Discord server in a volunteer capacity.

## Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

As a moderator on the NixOS Discord, I have experience mediating discussions, helping resolve conflicts, and supporting people, including newcomers. These experiences have taught me about what helps create trust, what causes friction, and how good communication across different channels matters.

Seeing what has [happened to the previous Steering Committee](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html) has inspired me to act. I would move to establish transparency in the Steering Committee, amending the constitution to require meeting minutes be taken and published at a bear minimum. I would also attempt to adopt a modified version of [Robert's Rules of Order](https://assembly.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/roberts_rules_simplified.pdf), which are designed for nonprofit bodies like our Steering Committee.
