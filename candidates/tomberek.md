### Conflict of interest disclosure

I helped found Flox and worked there, now I work for Anduril.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

My goal is to promulgate Nix/NixOS by using the network effects of large-scale adoption.

### What I have done

I am part of the inaugural Steering Committee where we established how we would work together, served as an escalation point for decisions, founded multiple teams, executed a formalized sponsorship program, and performed oversight functions for the community. I have establsihed trust with much of the community and have a record of being able to work broadly across the ecosystem to address issues. I've also worked on increasing the Nix contributor base, mentored Nixpkgs contributors, and helped organize Nix-focused conferences and events.

### What I will do

I will continue to create and organize events, try to establish partnerships and sponsorships, and work toward creating a sustainable Nix ecosystem.
