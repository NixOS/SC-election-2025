### Statement of Alignment

I am broadly aligned with [Julien Malka](https://github.com/JulienMalka), [Christina Sørensen](https://github.com/cafkafk), and [Niklas Korz](https://github.com/niklaskorz). We share similar perspectives on how the Steering Committee should operate and how it can best serve the Nix community.

I value their focus on collaboration, transparency, and accountability, and I believe that working with people who prioritize these principles will help make the Steering Committee more effective and responsive to the community’s needs.

While each of us is running independently, I am confident that our shared values and mutual respect will allow us to work well together if elected, ensuring that the Steering Committee functions as a cooperative and constructive body.

### Note on this application

This is essentially my **2024 candidate statement** with some updates.

My goals and commitments are very much the same, and I remain fully committed to **radical transparency** for the Steering Committee (SC).

I have also read [**Gabriella González’s SC retrospective**](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html), and the challenges raised there are of primary concern to me.

Everything below reflects those same core goals, with a few added ideas to strengthen accountability and community collaboration.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I am running for the Steering Committee because I have a deep love for Nix and its community, and I want to help it reach its full potential. Nix has been an integral part of my life for **over two years**, and I am fully committed to advancing it both technically and socially. The principles of declarativity, reproducibility, and reliability are what make Nix special compared to everything else today. I believe we can and should expand these to include automation, which will empower Nix to grow even further.

Nix is defined by its community. The passionate users and contributors are the heart of Nix, and that is why I am running to represent the community. I want to ensure that the Steering Committee operates with complete transparency, amplifying your voices and ensuring our governance is inclusive, reflecting the values we share.

On the technical side, my focus is on driving Nix forward by fostering innovation while safeguarding the stability that users depend on. My goal is to balance progress with the foundational principles that have made Nix a success, ensuring that it continues to evolve while staying true to its roots.

Additionally, I am deeply committed to advocating for copyleft and free software principles, ensuring that future Nix projects remain open, collaborative, and aligned with our shared vision of a free and open-source ecosystem. By integrating these values into every aspect of Nix’s growth, I believe we can secure its future as a leading force in the open-source world.

### What I Have Done

* Contributed to the out-of-tree [NixOS COSMIC flake](https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/nixos-cosmic) effort by packaging COSMIC apps in nixpkgs, creating the [NixOS COSMIC Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#cosmic:nixos.org), and initiating work to [upstream COSMIC to nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/259641).
* Active member of the COSMIC team.
* Authored multiple [PRs to nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+author%3Anyabinary) and continue to maintain several packages.
* Took part in governance discussions across Discourse, [Zulip](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/), and other community spaces—helping to bring those conversations to a conclusion.
* Played a role in exposing [Steering Committee misconduct](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/4), advocating for [accountability](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971) and [transparency](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828/85).

### What I'll do

As a member of the Steering Committee, I will continue to focus on the same key areas while adding a few new transparency measures inspired by Gabriella’s retrospective and community feedback.

#### Technical Goals

I will work closely with the **newly formed Nixpkgs Core Team and the Nix team** to help deliver these priorities:

* **Stabilize flakes as v0**, then develop next-gen (or “flakes v1”) flakes to address long-standing design issues.

* **Make flakes first-class, fully documented features**, ensuring flake-related issues are not blocked by their experimental status.

* **Encourage and help formalize a Nix language (nixlang) specification** to ensure consistency and clarity in development.

* **Improve and centralize all Nix-related documentation.**

* **Reduce reliance on proprietary platforms like Microsoft’s GitHub** by transitioning to self-hosted infrastructure where feasible.

* **Help establish clear communication channels with related projects** such as forks like **Lix** or entire rewrites like **Snix**, ensuring healthy collaboration among Nix implementations.

* **Explore integrating flake-parts into nixpkgs** as flakes become more stable.

* **Reduce nixpkgs size by removing abandoned and unmaintained packages** to keep the ecosystem lean and maintainable.

#### Governance Goals

To strengthen transparency and accountability of the SC itself, I will:

* **Mandate publishing of SC meeting notes and voting records**, and maintain public logs to the extent legally possible.

* **Publish quarterly financial reports** (donations, sponsorships, expenses) with spending tied to community-voted priorities.

* Support **community-initiated constitutional reform**, including a Governance RFC process and a mechanism for a supermajority of verified contributors to force or overturn changes.

* Establish **recall and accountability tools**, such as the ability to recall SC members (including performance-based triggers for repeated missed meetings or unfulfilled action items).

* Maintain **whistleblowing channels** for both SC and community members.

* Create **clear, privacy-respecting resignation policies** that include providing reasons when possible.

* Require SC members to maintain a **public registry of gifts, sponsorships, and employment ties**.

* Ensure **all SC work is properly recorded and backed up** for long-term transparency.

#### Community Goals

Because community is at the heart of Nix, I will also:

* **Lower the barrier to learning and contributing to Nix**, making it more accessible to newcomers and long-time users alike.

* **Hold regular town halls** (monthly or bi-monthly) and run structured online Q&A threads with guaranteed SC responses.

* Encourage **broad contributor participation in governance**, ensuring all voices, including those from underrepresented groups, are heard and valued.

* Promote a culture of **open dialogue with related projects and forks** so that the wider ecosystem thrives together.

* **Encourage and help set up mentorship programs for aspiring nixpkgs contributors,** so new maintainers can learn from experienced ones and grow into long-term roles.

These build on my standing commitment to stricter copyleft licensing, penalties for undisclosed conflicts of interest, and making sponsors and employers of board and SC members publicly known where legally viable.
