### Conflict of interest disclosure

- I am an employee of a private consultancy company in Belgium and have been
  working for the public sector at the European Commission as an external
  consultant for over 10 years.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

My journey with Nix began in 2019, and I quickly fell in love with its technical
elegance and the collaborative spirit of its community. However, I have grown
increasingly saddened by the politicization of the project, the erosion of
trust, and the growing division among us. Recent events have exposed a crisis in
our governance, shifting the focus from technical excellence to ideological
battles.

I am running for the Steering Committee to help restore balance, neutrality, and
transparency. My motivation comes from a deep belief in Nix's core values and a
desire to steer the project back to a path where technology and community spirit
are the priority. My family history, rooted in the experience of Italian
immigrants facing discrimination in Belgium, instilled in me a profound
commitment to fairness and inclusivity. I believe the most inclusive community
is one that remains neutral, providing a welcoming space for everyone,
regardless of their background or beliefs, to collaborate on great technology.

I stepped back from maintainership out of principle when I felt I could no
longer support the direction governance was taking. After many conversations at
NixCon and with other community members, I am now stepping forward to help fix
these issues from the inside. I want to help build a resilient, accountable, and
transparent governance structure so we can all work together toward our common
goal: making Nix the best tool for reproducible software.

### What I have done

My contributions to the Nix project are extensive and demonstrate my long-term
commitment:

- **Contribution to Nixpkgs**: I have made significant contributions to the Nix
  ecosystem, with approximately **1,000 merged pull requests**, **4,000
  reviews**.
- **PHP Ecosystem Maintainer**: I was a key contributor to the PHP ecosystem
  within Nix, building tools and improving Composer to enhance reproducibility
  for PHP applications.
- **Academic Work**: In 2024, I graduated with a
  [Master's in CS](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/reproducibility-in-software-engineering-thesis-has-been-published/51181).
  My thesis, "_Reproducibility in Software Engineering_", was inspired by my
  work with Nix and explores the core principles that make this project so
  powerful.
- **Community Engagement**: I am an active participant in the
  [NixOS Discourse forum](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/drupol) and the
  [Brussels Nix User Group](https://www.benix.be/). I also built
  [`markdown-code-runner`](https://github.com/drupol/markdown-code-runner), a
  tool now used in the NixOS documentation.
- **Advocacy**: I have been a vocal advocate for Nix, successfully guiding its
  adoption in several projects at my workplace at the European Commission and
  helping train colleagues.
- **Principled Resignation**: In August 2025, I
  [resigned from my maintainership](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/435310)
  roles in protest of the toxic environment and the lack of transparency and
  accountability in the project's governance and moderation. This difficult
  decision was a matter of principle and directly motivates my desire to improve
  and hopefully fix these issues as an SC member.

### What I will do

My goal as an SC member is to address the governance failures that have led to
division and mistrust. I will work to bring the focus back to technology and
collaboration. My 3 pillars:

**1. Overhaul Governance and Restore Trust**

The recent crises have shown that our governance model is broken. My first
priority is to restore trust through transparency, accountability, and a clear
separation of powers.

- **Mandate Radical Transparency**: I will push for all SC meeting minutes to be
  published within 48 hours. Eventually pushing for live-streamed "Town Hall"
  meetings where the community can directly engage with the SC.
- **End Unilateral Decisions**: I will propose a mandatory "Request for
  Comments" (RFC) process for all significant governance, branding, and policy
  changes. The SC’s role is to implement the community's will, not impose its
  own.
- **Address the Moderation Crisis**: The mass resignation of the moderation team
  was a failure of governance. I will call for an independent investigation into
  the SC's conduct and champion a new, community-developed moderation charter
  that guarantees the team's independence and prevents SC interference.
- **Define the SC's Limits**: The SC must serve the community, not rule it. I
  will work to create a publicly-ratified charter that defines the SC's
  responsibilities and limitations, including a clear "no confidence" mechanism
  for the community to hold members accountable.
- **Resist "State Capture"**: I am strongly opposed to reducing the SC's size to
  5 members. A 7-member committee is more representative and resilient against
  capture by any single faction. I will also formalize team memberships as a
  Conflict of Interest to prevent echo chambers.

**2. Strengthen the Contributor and Ecosystem Experience**

A healthy project requires a thriving and collaborative ecosystem. We must lower
the barrier to entry and establish clear, fair rules for everyone.

- **Champion the Contributor Experience**: As a contributor, I know the friction
  points. I will advocate for a radical improvement of our documentation, a
  structured mentorship program, and better tooling to streamline the
  contribution process.
- **Establish a Code of Conduct for Corporate Participation**: To handle
  conflicts with commercial entities, we need a formal code of conduct that
  applies to all companies. This will ensure a level playing field and provide
  clear rules on honest self-representation and community participation.
- **Clarify Relationships with Forks and Unofficial Spaces**: For forks, I
  support maintaining open communication for critical issues (e.g., security)
  but dedicating our official resources to the upstream Nix project. Unofficial
  communities should be clearly distinguished from official channels and not be
  endorsed or governed by the project.

**3. Uphold Principled Neutrality**

The Nix project should be a neutral ground for technical collaboration. The SC's
role is not to take moral stances on behalf of the community, but to manage
conflicts of interest and enforce rules transparently.

- **Delegate Sponsorship to a Neutral Body**: The SC should not be the arbiter
  of sponsors. I will push to delegate this responsibility to a dedicated
  committee that applies a clear, objective, and community-ratified sponsorship
  policy.
- **Focus on Process, Not Politics**: In situations like the Anduril issue, the
  SC’s job is to ensure immediate transparency and enforce a clear recusal
  policy for the conflicted member, not to litigate the morality of their
  employer. The integrity of our governance process must be the priority.
- **Acknowledge Nuance**: My own views on complex issues have evolved by
  listening to others in the community. There is rarely a simple black-or-white
  answer. The best way to remain inclusive is to focus on our shared passion for
  technology and maintain neutrality on external issues.


## Q&A

### Should the SC vote for confidence instead of for no-confidence? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472))


The [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#full-reelections) reads:

> A simple majority within the SC may call a reelection of the entire SC based on perceived loss of confidence.

This can lead to a 3-3 deadlock as we [currently](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) [see](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/6). In this deadlock, neither the reelection, nor any majority vote can pass - the SC is unable to function.

**In many legislatures, this is flipped into a vote of confidence that must pass to avoid a re-election.** This would have the same results for a full SC, but avoid situations like the current 3-3 deadlock.

Do you support amending the constitution accordingly?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472#issuecomment-3360100900">link</a>)</summary>

I am in full support of this proposal.

The current no-confidence mechanism, which requires a simple majority to trigger a new election, presents a clear and significant risk of deadlock. As pointed out, a split vote (e.g., 3-3) could paralyze the Steering Committee, leaving it unable to function or resolve its own internal gridlock, which would be detrimental to the entire NixOS project. Which is basically what happened.

Switching to a vote of confidence is an elegant and robust solution to this problem. It reframes the process from a reactive "vote to dissolve" to a proactive "vote to affirm" the committee's mandate. If a majority cannot actively express confidence in the current SC, it's a clear signal that a new election is necessary. This is a well-established and effective governance model used in many parliamentary systems for exactly this reason: **it prevents stagnation**.

It's encouraging to see the strong consensus in the comments. This change, would be a significant step forward for the stability and long-term health of NixOS governance.

### How would you handle an SC member joining Anduril? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190))


Recently, current SC member Tom Bereknyei took a new job at Anduril. After parts of the community [criticized](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971) the SC for not communicating this publicly, the SC gave a [statement](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/statement-on-a-steering-committee-member-joining-anduril/69007).

As an SC member, how would you like the SC to handle such a situation in the future?

*Please focus on the community aspects and be specific in what actions should be taken in such a scenario. This is not the place to discuss your opinion about the [MIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex).*

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190#issuecomment-3347107771">link</a>)</summary>

The core issue in such situations is a failure of the governance **process**.
Trust is broken when the community suspects that undisclosed conflicts are
influencing decisions in secret. The solution is not necessarily to force public
disclosure of private employment details, but to create a robust, transparent,
and verifiable process for managing conflicts of interest.

My proposed solution is a clear, constitutionally-mandated process:

1.  **Mandatory & Private Disclosure**: Any SC member must immediately and
    privately disclose any potential conflict of interest (including changes in
    employment) to the rest of the SC. This is a non-negotiable duty.

2.  **Formal Evaluation & Management Plan**: The SC must then formally evaluate
    the disclosure. If a significant conflict is identified, the SC will work
    with the member to create a formal, documented **recusal and management
    plan**. This plan will specify exactly which topics, discussions, and votes
    the member must abstain from.

3.  **Public Accountability of the Process**: The SC will then announce to the
    community:
    - That a potential conflict of interest has been disclosed and formally
      evaluated.
    - That a management plan has been instituted and the member will be recused
      from specific areas of governance.
    - The public meeting minutes and voting records will then clearly show this
      member as "recused (CoI)" on relevant topics, providing ongoing,
      verifiable proof that the conflict is being actively managed.

This approach ensures accountability and builds trust by making the _remedy_
transparent, without necessarily making the private details public. It shifts
the focus from "Who do you work for?" to "Is the conflict being handled
responsibly?" This protects the integrity of the SC while respecting the privacy
of its members.

### Should Nix transition away from GitHub to a self-hosted git forge? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/326))


(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/18 from the 2024 election)

Do you believe Nix should move away from GitHub and instead host its independent Git forge? If so, what are the benefits and challenges of such a transition, and how would you approach this shift if it were to happen?

If you already answered last year, it would probably totally be fine to just copy that answer.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/326#issuecomment-3380736581">link</a>)</summary>

Our project's heavy reliance on GitHub is a significant strategic and procedural vulnerability. For a community built on self-sufficiency, ceding control of our core infrastructure to a single proprietary entity limits accessibility for our global community and exposes us to external risks. Working towards greater digital sovereignty must be a long-term strategic goal.

However, a hasty "rip and replace" migration would be irresponsible. The only viable path is a pragmatic, transparent, baby-step-by-baby-step and and process-driven transition.

This is not about abandoning a tool that works quite well for most us now, but about maturely managing risk. By taking a measured, step-by-step approach to evaluating and adopting our own infrastructure, we can regain control over our project's core operations and bring our practices into alignment with the self-reliant, resilient ethos of Nix itself.

### Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265))


In https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html, current SC member Gabriella argues that 7 members are too many for the SC to operate efficiently and effectively.

With the experience we made after one year: Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265#issuecomment-3346782394">link</a>)</summary>

This is a fundamental question about the SC's operational effectiveness, and it's right to be asking it. It's clear from the retrospective and community observation that the first SC term struggled with inefficiency and gridlock. **The core of the debate is whether this was caused by the committee's size (7 members) or by its internal processes**. While I am sympathetic to the argument that a smaller group can be more agile, I believe the primary issues we faced were rooted in a lack of mature processes, not the size itself.

A committee of any size will be dysfunctional if its procedures are flawed. Foundational problems like absenteeism, a lack of clear communication protocols, and voting rules that allow inactive members to stall progress would cripple a group of five just as they would a group of seven. Before we make an irreversible structural change like reducing the committee's size, we must first address these procedural failings. Implementing strong transparency rules and clear policies on member participation, as I have advocated for elsewhere, would likely solve many of the symptoms that have been incorrectly attributed to the committee's size.

Furthermore, there is significant value in a 7-member committee that we should be cautious to discard. A larger group allows for a broader representation of our diverse, global community and brings more perspectives to the table. This diversity is a strength, as it helps guard against groupthink and ensures decisions are more thoroughly vetted. It also distributes the significant workload, reducing the risk of burnout for individual members. Reducing the size to five would risk concentrating both power and perspective in a way that may not fully serve the community's best interests.

Therefore, my position is to first focus on fixing our processes. Let us commit to a term of radical transparency, clear protocols, and accountability for all members. If, after implementing these changes, the committee still proves to be ineffective, then I would be fully supportive of re-evaluating the size based on that new evidence. But we must give a well-run, 7-member committee a chance to succeed before concluding that the structure itself is the inherent problem.

### Community participant behaviour regarding moderation decisions ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/477))


**Scenario**: While being suspended by a decision from the moderation team, a suspended community participant mass mails other community participants about a community matter. The recipients did not all have an existing relationship, or a good-standing relationship with the suspended individual.

**Question**: What do you think of this behaviour? How do you characterize this in regard of the expected conduct, and the values of this community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/477#issuecomment-3365232053">link</a>)</summary>

This is a complex situation, and I want to approach it with **nuance**. I had
the opportunity to meet Dawn at NixCon for the first time, where I gave a small
interview. I was genuinely impressed by the energy and dedication he puts into
his podcast _Full Time Nix_. He invests personal time to promote Nix and its
community, work that is incredibly valuable and something we need more of. While
I’m not personally comfortable with long interviews, I fully recognize the
positive impact of his efforts and I sincerely hope he continues promoting Nix
in such a unique way.

> Note 1: We are a community (_I know some people come and go, but that’s not
> the point here_) of passionate, imperfect individuals, and finding ways to
> **collaborate despite our differences is essential**, there's no other way
> forward.

On a personal level, I understand Dawn’s frustration. I won't comment on the
rightfulness of his suspension (_it's not relevant here and it's too late
anyway_). That said, I was not surprised with the email I received. I think his
suspension and the podcast/email he sent are two different things, and I believe
it’s important to separate them. **I cannot prevent someone from sending email,
but I can decide to engage or not**.

> Note 2: I didn’t even know he had been suspended until this question was
> opened. The `NixOS/moderation` repository is not one I actively watch, and
> without this thread, I would not have noticed the suspension at all.

That said, I don't think the future SC can do something about it either, we
won't be able to prevent suspended people from sending emails, writing on blogs,
or making videos. The question is, how do **we (as a community)** want to handle
this kind of situation in the future?

From a procedural perspective, when a community member communicates through
alternative channels during a suspension, it creates ambiguity. In this case,
that ambiguity was exploited through the creation of a question for potential SC
members. A suspension is intended as a tool for **de-escalation**. If its
boundaries are unclear, it can undermine the moderation process and place other
community members in awkward positions, unsure of how to engage. This isn’t
about pointing fingers at individuals; it’s about **acknowledging gaps in our
processes**. If the rules around communication during a suspension aren’t clear,
it opens the door to _unintended consequences_ that some would find
uncomfortable.

Instead, we should take this as an opportunity to **improve our processes**. As
an SC member, my focus would be on addressing these _unintended consequences_.
Specifically, I would advocate for:

1. A clear and public moderation chart: **Define precisely what a suspension
   entails for both parties**, including explicit rules on communication during
   the suspension period. This removes ambiguity and reduces the potential for
   unnecessary drama and conflict.
2. A fair and transparent appeals process: Establish a trusted mechanism for
   **appealing moderation decisions**. When people believe the system is fair,
   they are less likely to bypass it.
3. A culture of de-escalation: The SC should lead by example, promoting dialogue
   and **process-oriented solutions over punitive actions**.

My goals remain the same: to help build a system where conflicts are handled
through clear, fair, and transparent processes, so that we can concentrate on
what unites us: building great software **together**. Whenever ambiguity arises,
it’s a signal that our processes need refinement.

This approach respects individual contributors and safeguards the integrity of
our community structures.

### If mods are cops, who should decide on punishments? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464))


Related to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428 and the ongoing discussion on discourse about the resignation of the moderation team: https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828

I’ve seen different metaphors for what moderators are supposed to be. Some say moderators are like cops (enforcing rules), others say they’re like paramedics (helping people in crisis).

But no one has made the case for moderators as _judges_. If moderators are indeed tasked with enforcing rules, who then plays the role of the judiciary in our governance model? Do you think mods alone should be able to decide on the punishment (especially lifetime bans)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464#issuecomment-3356151247">link</a>)</summary>

That's a great question because it points to a big problem: we're asking our
moderators to be cops, paramedics, and judges all at once. That's not fair to
them, and it's not a healthy way to run a community.

To answer you directly: **No, I don't think mods alone should be deciding on
major punishments like permanent bans.**

Here’s a simpler, fairer way I think we could handle it:

1.  **Let Mods be First Responders.** Their main job should be to keep
    discussions healthy and safe. When a situation gets heated, they step in to
    de-escalate or give people a temporary time-out to cool off. They handle the
    immediate, day-to-day stuff.

2.  **Get a Second Opinion for Big Decisions.** For something as serious as a
    permanent ban, we need a "code review" for that decision. The moderation
    team could recommend a ban, but a separate **Community Review Group**, made
    up of other trusted community members, should take a second look. This group
    would hear out everyone involved and make sure the decision is fair before
    it becomes final.

The SC shouldn't be jumping into every single case: that’s micromanagement. Their
job is to be the architects of this hopefully fair system. They should help the
community create clear, simple rules for both the moderation team and the review
group. They make sure the process is working as intended, but they don't rule on
the cases themselves.

This approach means we can act fast when we need to, but we're also being
careful and fair when the stakes are high. It shares the responsibility, helps
prevent moderator burnout, and builds a system that more people can trust.

### What in the nix-sphere brings you joy? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/405))


This is intentionally a very open and low-stakes question. What in the nix-sphere brings you joy?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/405#issuecomment-3346675566">link</a>)</summary>

What brings me joy is the intersection of technical elegance and human
collaboration that this project represents.

- **The Power of Open Source**: My appreciation for Nix starts with my love for
  open-source, and `nixpkgs` feels like a pinnacle of that ideal. A vast, shared
  library of human knowledge.
- **The Process of Collaboration**: The project's global and transparent nature
  is incredible. I am constantly amazed by the brilliant minds I get to interact
  with. Every discussion on a PR is a chance to learn something new, not just
  technically, but about different ways of thinking. It is this process of
  mutual growth through open collaboration that I find most rewarding.
- **Productivity**: Nix's declarative approach to package management and system
  configuration is a joy to work with and a boost for productivity. The ability
  to define my entire system in code, and have it reproducibly built and
  deployed, is empowering. It transforms system administration from a chore into
  a creative act.
- **The Guarantee of Reproducibility**: And, of course, the simple fact that I
  can count on Nix. The guarantee that I can return to a project years later and
  have it work perfectly brings an immense and joyful peace of mind.

With all that said, NixOS brings also some kind of frustration when I see how
most of my friends and colleagues struggle with some tasks that are trivial on
NixOS, and how many of them are scared to even try it because of the perceived
complexity. I wish more people could experience the joy of NixOS.

### Stance on specific case of statements made by external actors ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/485))


The following was authored by @jaen but I'm posting it on their behalf because they cannot and I would like answers to it as well. The title of the issue was written by me.

---

The recent SC turmoil had been commented on outside the community in various venues. In particular, I'd like to draw attention to this [Twitter thread](https://xcancel.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1972037286192992320) where certain individuals talk about _“get[ting] these nut jobs out”_ and that _“[M]aybe @<!-- -->PalmerLuckey can help turn the ship around.”_ While the Anduril founder does not acknowledge those proposals directly, he says this:

> The good news is that Anduril will keep using Nix to build ever more powerful weapons for American dominance regardless of what the fringe "community" people say.

The question is, what is your stance on this thread — is it a nothingburger, or an indication of existential threat to community governance and self-sovereignity — and what steps, if any, do you plan to take to insulate the project against the threat, should it it materialise into something more concrete than online bickering.

And as a corollary to that, what does Nix governance and self-sovereignity means for you, do you feel it’s an important aspect for the SC to work towards and what would your be general policy to handle potential threats stemming from external actors looking to control the project to their own ends. Consider what limits — if any — you would seek to put on such a threat actor, how — if at all — could that extend to functions community members associated with them could perform at a maintainer and/or governance levels, for example to ensure the threat actor cannot pressure them into acting against the project's best interests.

Replying under the behalf of @GaetanLepage who is unable to add its own reply in this thread. He contacted me privately to ask if I could post it for him.

I agree with @crertel. In my view, the SC should not concern itself with monitoring Twitter or deciding whether an individual is welcome in the community based on what he (or his employer) is saying there.

Also, I see no evidence of that Anduril has taken any actions _harming the Nix community's self-sovereignty_. The fact that an Anduril employee is currently sitting on the SC is not, in itself, proof of any ill intent.

I think that it is important to draw a clear line between the actions individuals take _within_ the community and what Nix users do with the software or say in public spaces. You are, of course, free to personally disagree with certain uses of Nix (such as Anduril's), but this alone is not a sufficient reason for the SC to impose any coercive measure on them or their employees.
However, if some Anduril employees are clearly and actively violating community rules **within** official spaces, then sure, as with all members, they should face the appropriate response from the governing bodies.

### How should the SC communicate with the community? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199))


The [list of official announcements](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/announcements/steering-committee/57) from the first year of SC starts with two general updates in November and December 24, then continues with only specific announcement on certain topics. Even if a bit delayed, the Foundation has given [more updates](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/meta/nixos-foundation/47).

Arguably there was not much insight for the community into what the SC was working on.

How would an SC with you as a member, communicate with the community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199#issuecomment-3346802242">link</a>)</summary>

The current communication from the SC is a critical failure of governance.
Transparency is not a 'nice-to-have'; it is the absolute foundation of
procedural fairness and accountability. Without it, trust is impossible. My
guiding principle is that the SC must operate with a "working in the open"
philosophy, where the community can scrutinize our process, not just see the
final results.

To put this into practice, I will champion several concrete, non-negotiable
communication requirements:

1.  **Public Meeting Minutes**: The SC must publish minutes for every meeting.
    Any redactions must be rare, minimal, and publicly justified.
2.  **Regular, Scheduled Updates**: The SC must commit to a predictable summary
    of activities (e.g., bi-weekly or monthly) that outlines current
    discussions, recent decisions, and upcoming topics. This provides a reliable
    heartbeat of information.
3.  **Transparent Voting Records**: All votes must be public, with individual
    attribution. Decisions must be accompanied by both majority and minority
    rationales. This communicates the "why" behind a decision, not just the
    "what," and ensures every member is accountable for their position.
4.  **Direct Community Engagement**: To foster a true two-way exchange, the SC
    must hold periodic "Town Hall" sessions or public Q&A threads, allowing
    community members to engage with us directly.

Ultimately, the goal of this communication strategy is to demystify the Steering
Committee and subject it to public accountability. It should not be a remote
governing body, but an active, observable, and answerable part of the community
it serves. This is the only way to build a governance process the community can
trust.

**My first priority** would be to address the governance crisis caused by the
recent resignation of the moderation team. Until stability and trust are
restored, all other goals must remain secondary.

The immediate step is to secure stability in our community spaces by working
with remaining moderators and trusted members to form an interim solution. At
the same time, the new SC must listen, engaging with the former moderators, the
previous SC, and the community to fully understand the breakdown in trust. **This
is a time for dialogue and bridge-building, not top-down fixes**.

Once stability is achieved, the SC must lead a collaborative process to rebuild
the moderation framework: defining its role, its relationship to the SC, and
recruiting a new, empowered team. My role will be to facilitate this
conversation and ensure a sustainable outcome.

Beyond the crisis, I will not impose a personal agenda. The SC exists to set
priorities together. After resolving the moderation issue, I will work with my
colleagues to identify and agree on the project’s next strategic goals.

In short: crisis management first, then rebuilding trust, and finally empowering
the SC to function as a collaborative team dedicated to the health of the
community.

### How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197))


There is an [ongoing](https://discourse.nixos.org/search?q=Determinate%20Nix%20%23links%20in%3Atitle%20order%3Alatest) conflict between Determinate Systems and parts of the community. Some aspects of this, such as the "Nix the trademark" are likely things for the [foundation](https://github.com/nixos/foundation) to deal with.

However, Determinate Systems is *part of the community* as well, so this conflict also has aspects internal to the Nix community.

How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197#issuecomment-3346972963">link</a>)</summary>

I don't know if my personal opinion is relevant here, but I have nothing against
companies building on top of Nix. In fact, I believe that commercial entities
can play a vital role in the ecosystem by providing resources, funding, and
professional services that benefit the entire community. However, this must be
done in a way that respects the project's values and does not undermine its
integrity. That said...

The conflict surrounding Determinate Systems is a symptom of our own project's
procedural and developmental failings. DetSys has gained traction primarily by
addressing real, painful user problems that our official processes were too slow
to solve. They filled a vacuum that we, as a community, allowed to form.

The SC's role is not to engage in political battles with a commercial entity.
That is a distraction. The SC's role is to steer the project strategically.
Therefore, the only sustainable solution is to **make our official,
community-driven processes and offerings superior**.

My approach would be:

1.  **Declare a Strategic Priority**: The SC must formally mandate that
    stabilizing a first-class installer and providing a clear, stable path for
    core features like flakes are the project's highest priorities. This is a
    matter of strategic survival.
2.  **Empower the Teams**: With this clear mandate, the SC must empower the
    relevant technical teams to execute, providing them with the political cover
    and resources needed to make decisive progress. The goal is to unblock our
    own contributors.
3.  **Uphold Fair Conduct**: In parallel, the SC must ensure that all community
    discussions about any commercial entity, including DetSys, are governed by
    the same fair and transparent moderation process. We must protect the
    community from misleading marketing while ensuring criticism remains civil
    and productive.

We will not resolve this conflict by focusing on DetSys; we will resolve it by
focusing on ourselves. By building a fantastic official experience through a
healthy and efficient community process, we make third-party forks a matter of
niche preference, not a necessity. The SC's job is to lead the project to that
outcome through better governance, not through confrontation.

### How can contributing to Nix-the-implementation be made easier? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196))


It has repeatedly been mentioned in the past, that contributing to [Nix](https://github.com/nixos/nix) is hard.

What are the reasons for this from your perspective and how can this be improved?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196#issuecomment-3347037941">link</a>)</summary>

This question highlights a critical, long-term risk to the health of the entire
Nix ecosystem. The Nix implementation is the engine for everything we do, and if
contributing to it is too difficult, the project will inevitably stagnate. From
the SC's perspective, this is not just a technical problem for the Nix team to
solve; **it is a strategic priority that affects the sustainability of the whole
project**.

The reasons contributing is hard are multifaceted, as has been well-described
already. There is significant technical debt from over two decades of
development, and the complexity of the modern C++ codebase presents a formidable
barrier to entry. While we can't easily wish away this history, we must
recognize that the most acute and actionable problem is the social and
procedural one: **the bottleneck in PR review and the lack of a clear path for
new contributors to become trusted maintainers**.

The SC's primary responsibility here is to signal a strategic shift in
priorities. For too long, the focus has been on developing new, experimental
features. **The SC must formally and publicly state that improving the health of
our core implementation (which includes reviewing community contributions,
improving documentation, and paying down technical debt) is a top-level
priority**. This sends a clear message to the Nix team and the community about
where our collective energy should be directed.

A declaration of priorities must be backed by resources. **The SC should work
with the Foundation to allocate funding specifically for improving the
contributor experience**. This could take the form of funding dedicated roles
for PR triage and review, sponsoring documentation sprints, or paying developers
to focus on mentorship and onboarding new contributors to specific parts of the
codebase. We must be willing to invest real money in making our most critical
piece of software maintainable.

While a long-term rewrite in a more modern language is **an appealing dream**,
the immediate, practical path to a healthier Nix implementation is to invest in
the people and processes around the code we already have. By prioritizing
maintenance, funding the work, and fostering a culture of mentorship, we can
break the chicken-and-egg cycle and build a vibrant, sustainable community of
contributors around the heart of our project.

<summary>How transparent should the SC be? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407">link</a>)</summary>

In a [blog post](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html), resigned SC member @Gabriella439 recommended future SCs to increase transparency toward the community. (A different recommendation there, regarding SC size, is the subject of #265.)

In particular, the argument for this went (non-header emphasis mine):

> **Poor self-organization and internal policies/procedures**

[...]

> I think one of the big mistakes we made was that we insisted on **“speaking with one voice”**, meaning that we could not make any meaningful external statements or comments without getting majority approval from the committee (something we had difficulty with on the regular). This is why the committee remained largely silent or slow-to-respond on a large number of issues.

> This problem got bad enough that at some point many members began to break the wall of silence by commenting in an unofficial capacity on high-profile issues so that outsiders would get some visibility into what was going on instead of waiting for us to completely the slow process of gathering enough consensus and votes.

> Another internal policy that I believe was counter-productive was **not disclosing the final votes** on various issues or requiring individual signatories on public statements. Had we done this it would have likely broken a lot of internal stalemates and filibusters if all committee members were held publicly accountable for their policy positions (and therefore subject to public pressure).

> It would have also helped with another issue, which was:

> **Absenteeism**

> For various reasons (some justifiable, some not), at many points in time a large number of committee members would be unreachable, even during crucial junctures like ongoing controversy. This absenteeism was masked by the committee not publicizing that fact earlier. **If we had required all votes to be publicly recorded and all statements to require individual signatories** it would have exposed this absenteeism earlier (and led to quicker corrections).

As such, I would like to ask SC candidates: how do you regard the topic of SC transparency in light of @Gabriella439's recommendations, if not more generally? Further, how would you concretely enact these views in the SC, if elected?

<summary>politics of tech and governing values (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487">link</a>)</summary>

Whereas the existing Nix projects have licenses already, one popular adage states technology is not neutral - perhaps increasingly obviously so, as the impact of technology continues to grow.

As such, zooming out a bit, one of the topics the community has seen different takes on seems whether we should govern by certain values, as exemplified by actions such as the earlier open letter against MIC sponsorships, a sentiment that seemed represented among contributors, or 'keep politics out', a sentiment that has seemed represented more at e.g. the NixOS sub-reddit.

<summary>Who are "The Nix Community", and why? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/436">link</a>)</summary>

One outcome of the NCA was the "Constitution", which advertises "Values". It falls short, however, of "constituting a community": it does not attempt to describe anything resembling a "membership predicate", a matter that was intensively discussed in the Governance Zulip. I'm interested in the candidates' reasoning and reflection about the community's composition, but here's also a few litmus tests:

- Are DetSys and Anduril "part of the community"?
- Is Jon Ringer "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Is srid "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Generally, how does moderation action affect "community membership"?
- Are former maintainers, who resigned in support of either of the two Open Letters, "part of the community"?
  - If they have not contributed back to the project since?
  - If they participate in discussions on Discourse or in Social Media?
  - If they contribute only to forks?
  - If they contribute to forks, but backport ad hoc?
- Are Lix, Snix, the Foundation, or the nix-community "part of the community"?
- Are NixCon Sponsors "part of the community"?
- Of participants of Nix-Offtopic and Discourse, are those, who do not "contribute" code, documentation, or decision-making, still "part of the community"?

Finally,

- Are people who disagree with the composition or the priorities of the "Values" part of the community?

I would like to specifically add that the party in question might escalate the matter into the court of public opinion.

In the answers from the previous year there was a very clear dividing line among candidates about not only using explicit powers granted by the constitution, versus using activism.

Would you advocate for the SC using activism proactively?
Would you advocate for the SC using activism once a matter is moved into the court of public opinion?
How do you think the SC should react to activism?
At what point should the SC concede to activist pressures?

<summary>Should electoral alliances/coalitions count as conflicts of interest? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/479">link</a>)</summary>

Related to #470.

It has been brought to my attention that several candidates are interested in forming electoral coalitions[^1] where candidates agree to vote for each other in time for the election. This could significantly change the result of the election, especially if coalitions decide to formalize which candidates they choose to vote for and which they do not, and if many members of the same coalition are elected to office, their shared interests could dominate the SC. In spite of this, there are currently no rules in place that will require electoral coalition/alliance status to be disclosed in each candidate's statement. 

Do you think participation in coalitions and alliances *has to be* disclosed? If not, do you think they *should* be disclosed?

A trademark is direly needed, as there are many commercial projects who use "Nix" in their name for marketing purposes, sometimes confusingly.

Documentation is often cited as being lackluster, incomplete, or confusing. Personally, I disagree; I've seen many improvements to documentation over the years, and I think it has come a long way. Still, those improvements don't address the core issue for why documentation *feels* lackluster.

IMO, the issue is because the boundaries between projects are not clear. A new NixOS user will look at the NixOS manual for help: but really, they are using Nix+Nixpkgs+NixOS stack. For a beginner, it is not clear why there would be three manuals, and where the boundaries lie, and which manual they need (especially when interacting with a layering violation). This provides a frustrating experience, where despite the information being abundant, it is not at all discoverable in a relevant fashion.

Is this something that you are concerned with? What do you want to do with it? Direct more resources into cross-cutting documentation projects, like nix.dev or wiki.nixos.org ? Work on clearer project boundaries? Attempt to bridge documentation?

Nix is a central piece of the ecosystem, and Nix team holds authority over it. Additionally, many Nix team members are a long-time, trusted community members, making them overwhelmingly more likely to be elected. One of the purposes of SC is to coordinate different teams; this poses a clear conflict of interest, when someone is in both Nix team and SC, as that person's interests as an SC member and Nix team member are not necessarily aligned.

Right now, the ecosystem is very split between permissive licenses (MIT), copyleft-ish licenses (LGLP, MPL), and copyleft licenses (GPL). This signifies a wider disagreement between people on what community is, and what to expect.

Licenses are by no means perfect, but they signify intention and direction. They are like a COC: adopting one doesn't instantly solve all of your problems (nor is expected to), but it shows where the project is heading. This has a lot of consequences later down the line. It could be argued that Nixpkgs being MIT-licensed is a reason why there are so many companies hanging around it; it could likewise be argued that the reason DetSys hasn't been more successful with their "downstream distribution" has to do with LGPL.

What is your view on licensing? Are you planning to put out guidelines for licensing official and community projects? Pursue relicensing various projects?

<summary>How are you going to reform SC? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/284">link</a>)</summary>

To me, SC results were disappointing. Despite the community having clearly cast their votes, not much of substance was achieved in a year. This is indicative of a "committee" situation: where consensus is required to make any decisions. This poses an existential threat to the effectiveness of SC, as SC is meant to represent very diverse parts of the community, that often have conflicting interests. Achieving consensus in such a case is a pipe dream.

That's why SC members need a lot more autonomy, to be able to make decisions on their own (overriden by majority, if significant opposition arises) and not get blocked by achieving impossible consensus. This is the entire purpose of SC, as consensus-driven decisions were made with RFCs, and ran into all the same issues.

Considering this, how would you reform the SC to allow for more individual action and autonomy?

<summary>Currently sitting SC members running for reelection: why did you vote the way you did on a vote of no confidence on 2025-09-30? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/452">link</a>)</summary>

Today, [a reply by @jtojnar](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) on the whistleblowing post mentioned that the Steering Committee held a vote of no confidence today, 30 September 2025.

> Vote of no confidence of the entire SC 2025-09-30 (failed 3/6)
> * Ericson2314: -1
> * Gabriella439: +1
> * jtojnar: +1
> * roberth: -1

A "yes" vote to a vote of no confidence implies that the individual does not have trust in the SC. A "no" vote implies that there is still some trust left.

Why did you vote the way that you did?

<summary>If you are re-elected, how did you vote on previous issues? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/282">link</a>)</summary>

In a similar vein to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/256, opinions on past incidents present an important benchmark to judge candidate's moral and practical compass. This is even more important for existing SC members. SC has some out as a single front to make coordinated statements; I believe that to be an important mistake, that allows SC members to hide behind a bureaucratic body and avoid any kind of accountability. I believe it to be highly unfair. For that reason, I would like to know the historical votes of SC members on various issues.
