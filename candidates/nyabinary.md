### Conflict of interest disclosure

None.

---

### Statement of Alignment

I am broadly aligned with [Julien Malka](https://github.com/JulienMalka), [Christina Sørensen](https://github.com/cafkafk), and [Niklas Korz](https://github.com/niklaskorz). We share similar perspectives on how the Steering Committee should operate and how it can best serve the Nix community.

I value their focus on collaboration, transparency, and accountability, and I believe that working with people who prioritize these principles will help make the Steering Committee more effective and responsive to the community’s needs.

While each of us is running independently, I am confident that our shared values and mutual respect will allow us to work well together if elected, ensuring that the Steering Committee functions as a cooperative and constructive body.

---

### Note on this application

This is essentially my **2024 candidate statement** with some updates.

My goals and commitments are very much the same, and I remain fully committed to **radical transparency** for the Steering Committee (SC).

I have also read [**Gabriella González’s SC retrospective**](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html), and the challenges raised there are of primary concern to me.

Everything below reflects those same core goals, with a few added ideas to strengthen accountability and community collaboration.

---

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I am running for the Steering Committee because I have a deep love for Nix and its community, and I want to help it reach its full potential. Nix has been an integral part of my life for **over two years**, and I am fully committed to advancing it both technically and socially. The principles of declarativity, reproducibility, and reliability are what make Nix special compared to everything else today. I believe we can and should expand these to include automation, which will empower Nix to grow even further.

Nix is defined by its community. The passionate users and contributors are the heart of Nix, and that is why I am running to represent the community. I want to ensure that the Steering Committee operates with complete transparency, amplifying your voices and ensuring our governance is inclusive, reflecting the values we share.

On the technical side, my focus is on driving Nix forward by fostering innovation while safeguarding the stability that users depend on. My goal is to balance progress with the foundational principles that have made Nix a success, ensuring that it continues to evolve while staying true to its roots.

Additionally, I am deeply committed to advocating for copyleft and free software principles, ensuring that future Nix projects remain open, collaborative, and aligned with our shared vision of a free and open-source ecosystem. By integrating these values into every aspect of Nix’s growth, I believe we can secure its future as a leading force in the open-source world.

### What I Have Done

* Contributed to the out-of-tree [NixOS COSMIC flake](https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/nixos-cosmic) effort by packaging COSMIC apps in nixpkgs, creating the [NixOS COSMIC Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#cosmic:nixos.org), and initiating work to [upstream COSMIC to nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/259641).
* Active member of the COSMIC team.
* Authored multiple [PRs to nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+author%3Anyabinary) and continue to maintain several packages.
* Took part in governance discussions across Discourse, [Zulip](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/), and other community spaces—helping to bring those conversations to a conclusion.
* Played a role in exposing [Steering Committee misconduct](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/4), advocating for [accountability](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971) and [transparency](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828/85).

### What I'll do

As a member of the Steering Committee, I will continue to focus on the same key areas while adding a few new transparency measures inspired by Gabriella’s retrospective and community feedback.

#### Technical Goals

I will work closely with the **newly formed Nixpkgs Core Team and the Nix team** to help deliver these priorities:

* **Stabilize flakes as v0**, then develop next-gen (or “flakes v1”) flakes to address long-standing design issues.

* **Make flakes first-class, fully documented features**, ensuring flake-related issues are not blocked by their experimental status.

* **Encourage and help formalize a Nix language (nixlang) specification** to ensure consistency and clarity in development.

* **Improve and centralize all Nix-related documentation.**

* **Reduce reliance on proprietary platforms like Microsoft’s GitHub** by transitioning to self-hosted infrastructure where feasible.

* **Help establish clear communication channels with related projects** such as forks like **Lix** or entire rewrites like **Snix**, ensuring healthy collaboration among Nix implementations.

* **Explore integrating flake-parts into nixpkgs** as flakes become more stable.

* **Reduce nixpkgs size by removing abandoned and unmaintained packages** to keep the ecosystem lean and maintainable.

#### Governance Goals

To strengthen transparency and accountability of the SC itself, I will:

* **Mandate publishing of SC meeting notes and voting records**, and maintain public logs to the extent legally possible.

* **Publish quarterly financial reports** (donations, sponsorships, expenses) with spending tied to community-voted priorities.

* Support **community-initiated constitutional reform**, including a Governance RFC process and a mechanism for a supermajority of verified contributors to force or overturn changes.

* Establish **recall and accountability tools**, such as the ability to recall SC members (including performance-based triggers for repeated missed meetings or unfulfilled action items).

* Maintain **whistleblowing channels** for both SC and community members.

* Create **clear, privacy-respecting resignation policies** that include providing reasons when possible.

* Require SC members to maintain a **public registry of gifts, sponsorships, and employment ties**.

* Ensure **all SC work is properly recorded and backed up** for long-term transparency.

#### Community Goals

Because community is at the heart of Nix, I will also:

* **Lower the barrier to learning and contributing to Nix**, making it more accessible to newcomers and long-time users alike.

* **Hold regular town halls** (monthly or bi-monthly) and run structured online Q&A threads with guaranteed SC responses.

* Encourage **broad contributor participation in governance**, ensuring all voices, including those from underrepresented groups, are heard and valued.

* Promote a culture of **open dialogue with related projects and forks** so that the wider ecosystem thrives together.

* **Encourage and help set up mentorship programs for aspiring nixpkgs contributors,** so new maintainers can learn from experienced ones and grow into long-term roles.

These build on my standing commitment to stricter copyleft licensing, penalties for undisclosed conflicts of interest, and making sponsors and employers of board and SC members publicly known where legally viable.

## Q&A

### Should the SC vote for confidence instead of for no-confidence? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472))


The [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#full-reelections) reads:

> A simple majority within the SC may call a reelection of the entire SC based on perceived loss of confidence.

This can lead to a 3-3 deadlock as we [currently](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) [see](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/6). In this deadlock, neither the reelection, nor any majority vote can pass - the SC is unable to function.

**In many legislatures, this is flipped into a vote of confidence that must pass to avoid a re-election.** This would have the same results for a full SC, but avoid situations like the current 3-3 deadlock.

Do you support amending the constitution accordingly?

### How would you handle an SC member joining Anduril? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190))


Recently, current SC member Tom Bereknyei took a new job at Anduril. After parts of the community [criticized](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971) the SC for not communicating this publicly, the SC gave a [statement](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/statement-on-a-steering-committee-member-joining-anduril/69007).

As an SC member, how would you like the SC to handle such a situation in the future?

*Please focus on the community aspects and be specific in what actions should be taken in such a scenario. This is not the place to discuss your opinion about the [MIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex).*

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190#issuecomment-3356154005">link</a>)</summary>

I agree with @niklaskorz and @pluiedev on the need for codifying CoI disclosures and making them mandatory. I'd also go further and support making individuals working in certain sectors like the military-industrial complex ineligible to run for the SC, as these affiliations fundamentally undermine community trust and sows chaos in the community.

### Course of action for nixos.wiki ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/474))


The nixos.wiki is often the first result when searching in Google for nix related questions, even though the official wiki is at wiki.nixos.org. What should be done to fix this?

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/474#issuecomment-3394318045">link</a>)</summary>

I agree with what @pluiedev said, in reality there's not much the SC can do except advocate for expediting the creation of a trademark policy. I agree it's not really ideal and would like to see the SC attempt to try and reach out to the owner of the unofficial wiki again.

### Should the Steering Committee keep and publish meeting minutes? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/434))


Should the Steering Committee keep and publish meeting minutes?

Meeting minutes are, in short, a way of recording any decisions and discussion that occurred during a meeting.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/434#issuecomment-3358304366">link</a>)</summary>

Yes, I'd go further as well, publishing monthly reports/summaries of the work the SC has done.
</details>

### Should Nix transition away from GitHub to a self-hosted git forge? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/326))


(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/18 from the 2024 election)

Do you believe Nix should move away from GitHub and instead host its independent Git forge? If so, what are the benefits and challenges of such a transition, and how would you approach this shift if it were to happen?

If you already answered last year, it would probably totally be fine to just copy that answer.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/326#issuecomment-3394239870">link</a>)</summary>

Yes, I believe Nix should begin moving toward a self-hosted Git forge. This transition should be very gradual and carefully planned to ensure stability, with early evaluations of infrastructure, contributor experience, and integration challenges. My rationale for this is that the growing enshitification of GitHub and Microsoft’s push toward AI integration make long-term reliance on it risky, both ethically and practically. To help with this effort we should explore sponsorship opportunities where it arises to help fund this effort and work closely with the Nixpkgs Core Team and other teams to make the transition smooth and realistic.

### Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265))


In https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html, current SC member Gabriella argues that 7 members are too many for the SC to operate efficiently and effectively.

With the experience we made after one year: Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265#issuecomment-3394191441">link</a>)</summary>

I’m leaning toward keeping the Steering Committee at seven members for now, as a broader group allows for more workload distribution and accountability in my eyes. I believe the challenges around coordination and efficiency are real, but I think they stem more from process and communication gaps than from size alone. Before reducing the number, we should explore remedies like clearer role definitions, structured decision-making, and better facilitation tools. If after those adjustments the SC still struggles to operate effectively, then revisiting a smaller member count could be reasonable.
</details>

### How would you treat SC members with completely opposite political leanings? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/489))


As the title suggests, if some SC members have completely different political affiliations and governance ideas than you, and often disagree with you on decision-making, how would you treat them? How would you ensure that you fulfill your responsibilities?

More seriously, if you find that the faction you represent is not the majority in the SC, what will you do?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/489#issuecomment-3394363142">link</a>)</summary>

I agree with both @cafkafk and @pluiedev. I’ll treat everyone with respect, but I also believe that collaboration doesn’t mean I'll abandon my principles either. I value equity, inclusion, and collective decision-making. Even when disagreements arise, I’ll focus on finding common ground through empathy and dialogue, while still standing firm on protecting the community’s well-being. I need to stress that while compromise is indeed very important that it should never come at the cost of our shared values or the safety and inclusion of others. Respect, civility, and trust foremost.

### Community participant behaviour regarding moderation decisions ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/477))


**Scenario**: While being suspended by a decision from the moderation team, a suspended community participant mass mails other community participants about a community matter. The recipients did not all have an existing relationship, or a good-standing relationship with the suspended individual.

**Question**: What do you think of this behaviour? How do you characterize this in regard of the expected conduct, and the values of this community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/477#issuecomment-3394324875">link</a>)</summary>

I don’t think that kind of behavior was appropriate at all, especially while under suspension, as it undermines the moderation process and puts others in an uncomfortable position. I won’t be on Dawn podcast, but I also want to be clear that I don’t hold any ill will toward Dawn personally as were all human.

### How transparent should the SC be? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407))


In a [blog post](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html), resigned SC member @Gabriella439 recommended future SCs to increase transparency toward the community. (A different recommendation there, regarding SC size, is the subject of #265.)

In particular, the argument for this went (non-header emphasis mine):

> **Poor self-organization and internal policies/procedures**

[...]

> I think one of the big mistakes we made was that we insisted on **“speaking with one voice”**, meaning that we could not make any meaningful external statements or comments without getting majority approval from the committee (something we had difficulty with on the regular). This is why the committee remained largely silent or slow-to-respond on a large number of issues.

> This problem got bad enough that at some point many members began to break the wall of silence by commenting in an unofficial capacity on high-profile issues so that outsiders would get some visibility into what was going on instead of waiting for us to completely the slow process of gathering enough consensus and votes.

> Another internal policy that I believe was counter-productive was **not disclosing the final votes** on various issues or requiring individual signatories on public statements. Had we done this it would have likely broken a lot of internal stalemates and filibusters if all committee members were held publicly accountable for their policy positions (and therefore subject to public pressure).

> It would have also helped with another issue, which was:

> **Absenteeism**

> For various reasons (some justifiable, some not), at many points in time a large number of committee members would be unreachable, even during crucial junctures like ongoing controversy. This absenteeism was masked by the committee not publicizing that fact earlier. **If we had required all votes to be publicly recorded and all statements to require individual signatories** it would have exposed this absenteeism earlier (and led to quicker corrections).

As such, I would like to ask SC candidates: how do you regard the topic of SC transparency in light of @Gabriella439's recommendations, if not more generally? Further, how would you concretely enact these views in the SC, if elected?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407#issuecomment-3358307864">link</a>)</summary>

I would advocate for a maximalist approach to transparency, pushing to publish everything we can except in cases where it's legally not viable and in cases where privacy is a concern. In cases of legal issues I support redacting the legally sensitive areas and releasing the document and then unsealing the entire document when it's legally viable to do so.

### Are you in any coalitions with other candidates? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/470))


Are you aligned with other candidates in e.g. a coalition? What is your coalition about, **broadly speaking**? (Please put the finer points of your coalition's answers into other relevant questions. This question is asking for coalitions to self-identify.)

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/470#issuecomment-3394322182">link</a>)</summary>

No, I’m not part of any formal coalition, but I’m aligned with and endorse the following candidates:

Aligned with:
@JulienMalka @niklaskorz @cafkafk 

Endorsements:
@K900 @tomodachi94 @jopejoe1 @leona-ya @pluiedev @Scrumplex @samueldr and @getchoo 

We share similar values around transparency, community accountability, and ensuring Nix remains a truly free and community-driven project.

### If mods are cops, who should decide on punishments? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464))


Related to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428 and the ongoing discussion on discourse about the resignation of the moderation team: https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828

I’ve seen different metaphors for what moderators are supposed to be. Some say moderators are like cops (enforcing rules), others say they’re like paramedics (helping people in crisis).

But no one has made the case for moderators as _judges_. If moderators are indeed tasked with enforcing rules, who then plays the role of the judiciary in our governance model? Do you think mods alone should be able to decide on the punishment (especially lifetime bans)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464#issuecomment-3394309594">link</a>)</summary>

I think the framing of moderators as cops is the wrong approach entirely. Moderators should not be seen as enforcers or punitive actors but as facilitators of community health and dialogue. The goal for moderation should be restorative and transformative justice, focusing on addressing harm, rebuilding trust, and helping people reintegrate when possible. Punishments like lifetime bans should be a last resort, handled transparently and with accountability. If someone has shown genuine growth or change over time, they should have the right to return to the community, as the goal should always be transformation rather than exclusion.

### What in the nix-sphere brings you joy? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/405))


This is intentionally a very open and low-stakes question. What in the nix-sphere brings you joy?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/405#issuecomment-3394283415">link</a>)</summary>

What brings me happiness in the Nix sphere is the spirit of cooperation and creativity that defines the community. I truly do love seeing how people come together to solve complex problems, push technical boundaries, and build tools that make computing more reproducible and elegant. It makes me genuinely happy to see people gather around a shared passion, finding common ground in something that challenges and inspires them. Watching the community grow, connect, and thrive through collaboration and shared purpose is one of the best parts of being involved. TL;DR: hearty nerd stuff :p
</details>

### Should community-related Conflicts of Interest be considered for the SC election? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192))


The [constitution explicitly mentions](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#conflict-of-interest-coi-balance) "employees of the same company or otherwise the same payer for Nix work" as *examples* of Conflicts of Interest for the constitution of the SC.

In the current SC, we had three members of the Nix team (Ericson2314, roberth, tomberek) and two members of the commit bit delegation team (jtojnar, winterqt), which arguably reduces diversity as well.

Should team-memberships in the community also be considered as Conflicts of Interest for the SC election? Why (not)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3356185503">link</a>)</summary>

I’m running to push for stronger conflict of interest rules that apply to all relevant affiliations within the Nix ecosystem. This includes internal teams in the Nix organization, contributors involved in alternative Nix implementations, and any other groups that could influence decision-making. These relationships have the potential to carry just as much weight as paid employment when it comes to shaping outcomes and priorities within the project. Ignoring them risks creating blind spots in governance and eroding community trust, which is the opposite of what we need. That is why I believe full transparency must be a requirement, not a suggestion, and I intend to advocate for making that the standard.
</details>

### What is the goal of community moderation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428))


What, in your opinion, is the goal of community moderation?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428#issuecomment-3394289494">link</a>)</summary>

I agree with @pluiedev perspective that the goal of moderation should be to prevent and de-escalate harmful conflicts rather than simply enforcing etiquette. Moderation should focus on maintaining the collective health of the community by addressing harm transparently, fairly, and with empathy. Furthermore, I believe the moderation team’s goal is to cultivate a community grounded in shared values and resolve conflicts through diplomatic and restorative approaches. I would also like to see the moderation team take inspiration from transformative justice principles where possible, focusing on accountability, healing, and growth rather than punishment, to strengthen trust and resilience within the community.
</details>

### How would you act on the moderation team's call to SC candidates? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/390))


When a large part of the moderation team [stepped down](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828) they asked for:

> **We call on the SC candidates:** to commit to implementing a Constitution reform that will require transparency and accountability from the SC, with teams like technical steering and moderation providing a counterbalance.

How would you act as a member of the next SC in this matter?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/390#issuecomment-3394276825">link</a>)</summary>

I agree with the moderation team’s call for greater transparency and accountability within the Steering Committee. You can look at my candidate statement to see that I am firmly committed to these principles and have consistently emphasized openness, communication, and community oversight. I would support reforms that strengthen checks and balances between the SC, moderation, and technical teams to ensure decisions are transparent, well-documented, and accountable to the broader community.
</details>

### Stance on specific case of statements made by external actors ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/485))


The following was authored by @jaen but I'm posting it on their behalf because they cannot and I would like answers to it as well. The title of the issue was written by me.

---

The recent SC turmoil had been commented on outside the community in various venues. In particular, I'd like to draw attention to this [Twitter thread](https://xcancel.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1972037286192992320) where certain individuals talk about _“get[ting] these nut jobs out”_ and that _“[M]aybe @<!-- -->PalmerLuckey can help turn the ship around.”_ While the Anduril founder does not acknowledge those proposals directly, he says this:

> The good news is that Anduril will keep using Nix to build ever more powerful weapons for American dominance regardless of what the fringe "community" people say.

The question is, what is your stance on this thread — is it a nothingburger, or an indication of existential threat to community governance and self-sovereignity — and what steps, if any, do you plan to take to insulate the project against the threat, should it it materialise into something more concrete than online bickering.

And as a corollary to that, what does Nix governance and self-sovereignity means for you, do you feel it’s an important aspect for the SC to work towards and what would your be general policy to handle potential threats stemming from external actors looking to control the project to their own ends. Consider what limits — if any — you would seek to put on such a threat actor, how — if at all — could that extend to functions community members associated with them could perform at a maintainer and/or governance levels, for example to ensure the threat actor cannot pressure them into acting against the project's best interests.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/485#issuecomment-3394341639">link</a>)</summary>

I agree with what @pluiedev said.

Palmer’s comments are completely contrary to the values of the Nix community, which is built on collaboration, openness, and respect across borders. Nix should be an inclusive space that welcomes people from all backgrounds, and to uphold that ideal, it must actively reject and stand against exclusionary ideologies in any form. The community’s strength comes from its diversity and shared belief in cooperation and freedom, not domination or division.
</details>

### What should happen in the event of an SC member resigning early? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481))


The SC is currently elected by proportional representation, which seeks to reflect the preferences of its voters.
However, over this initial SC term we have seen multiple early resignations, potentially making what remains of the SC less representative of its voter base, if not also affecting [decision-making capabilities](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/some-procedural-clarifications-on-the-constitution/70278).

Now, there may be alternate ways to deal with scenarios involving early retirement, including going over the original votes to recalculate what alternate candidate might best represent this part of the electorate, or (eventually) even calling new elections.

As a candidate to the body in charge of our constitution, how would you ideally see these cases handled?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481#issuecomment-3394332568">link</a>)</summary>

I agree with the recent decision by the SC to have an Election Committee on standby throughout the year, as this ensures swift and efficient reelections when vacancies occur. I also believe there should be clearly defined deadlines for these reelections, with a requirement that they happen within that timeframe. This would prevent situations where either the SC or EC delays the process by continuously pushing back the election date, ensuring accountability and consistent community representation.
</details>

### How should the SC communicate with the community? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199))


The [list of official announcements](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/announcements/steering-committee/57) from the first year of SC starts with two general updates in November and December 24, then continues with only specific announcement on certain topics. Even if a bit delayed, the Foundation has given [more updates](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/meta/nixos-foundation/47).

Arguably there was not much insight for the community into what the SC was working on.

How would an SC with you as a member, communicate with the community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199#issuecomment-3394184417">link</a>)</summary>

The Steering Committee should communicate with the community through open, transparent, and consistent channels that encourage participation. All decisions, discussions, and rationales should be publicly accessible by default, with meeting notes and clear announcements shared across major platforms such as Discourse, Matrix, and GitHub. The SC should also hold regular reports and Q&A sessions to build trust, maintain alignment, and ensure communication remains two-way, inclusive, and accountable.

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/195#issuecomment-3356510335">link</a>)</summary>

What I'll push heavily for is the following:

### **Month 1: Transparency and Trust-Building**

* Focus on rebuilding trust with the Nix community through real transparency and open communication.
* Publishing SC meeting minutes, voting records, and recording SC calls.
* Begin holding personal open office hours.
* Propose and help organize monthly or bimonthly community town halls.
* Establish respectful communication channels with forks and re-implementations like Lix and Snix.
* Push for anonymous whistle-blowing mechanisms for safe, confidential reporting of concerns.

---

### **Months 2–3: Structural Integrity and Delegation**

* Ensure regular backups of SC logs to prevent data loss and institutional memory issues.
* Advocate for atomic governance by publicizing git commit history for transparent and traceable decision-making.
* Begin publishing monthly reports summarizing SC activities and decisions.
* Propose releasing quarterly financial reports so the community can track how resources are used.
* Work on establishing clear delegation of technical and community responsibilities to appropriate teams, so the SC can focus on strategic direction while empowering contributors.
* Propose introducing SC observers who attend meetings and report independently to the community to improve oversight and accountability of the SC.

### Would you join in an Election Integrity Pledge? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/488))


Everybody running feels strongly about serving the Nix community by running for election, but we also know that not all of us are going to get elected.

I'd like to ask if my colleagues would join me in publicly declaring their belief in an orderly and peaceful election and governance process. *Even if not elected, all of us can serve the community by setting a good example of behavior and decorum!*


### The Election Integrity Pledge:

>As a candidate for the Steering Committee, in order to demonstrate a good community spirit and trust, I hereby pledge that henceforth...
>
>* ...I believe that as a community we are here to do our best work and to ship code.
>* ...I support and celebrate the democratic nature of our elections.
> * ...if elected, I will dutifully and in good-faith participate in all SC work for as long as I have a seat.
> * ...elected or not, I will support the SC and the governance processes, and refrain from slandering or libeling SC members or candidates, or misrepresenting SC actions in public spaces.
> * ...I will not participate in, encourage, or aid public pressure campaigns against the SC, its members, or its candidates.
> * ...I will act with integrity and honor in the discharge of my duties.


If you agree, please reply simply with:

> I sign and support the Election Integrity Pledge.

Thank you.

This is a badly phrased question. I agree with both @K900 and @cafkafk here. The pledge as written feels one-sided and risks discouraging legitimate criticism or accountability toward the Steering Committee. Supporting election integrity should not mean pledging unconditional loyalty to those in power, and the language here reads more like an attempt to silence dissent than to promote respectful discourse. Integrity comes from transparency, honesty, and the ability to question authority when necessary, not from suppressing criticism.

### politics of tech and governing values ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487))


Whereas the existing Nix projects have licenses already, one popular adage states technology is not neutral - perhaps increasingly obviously so, as the impact of technology continues to grow.

As such, zooming out a bit, one of the topics the community has seen different takes on seems whether we should govern by certain values, as exemplified by actions such as the earlier open letter against MIC sponsorships, a sentiment that seemed represented among contributors, or 'keep politics out', a sentiment that has seemed represented more at e.g. the NixOS sub-reddit.

As a candidate, where do you stand on this? What values should we expect you to hold?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487#issuecomment-3394349525">link</a>)</summary>

I agree completely with what @cafkafk said. Furthermore, technology and software are never neutral, and I believe software and politics are inherently intertwined whether we like it or not. Every choice in how we design, distribute, and use technology reflects the values we hold. For transparency stake I would like to mention that personally I lean left on the political spectrum, which means I strongly believe in collective responsibility, equity, and the idea that our work should serve the public good. As a community, I believe we should make sure Nix aligns with values of openness, inclusivity, and social responsibility rather than faux-neutrality that in my eyes enables harm.

### Voter mechanisms to recall individual candidates ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482))


Over the past days, there have been [multiple](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971/) [calls](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/) for individual SC candidates to step down, or even calling for a [full reelection](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/).

Current procedures have yet to take into account such desires, meaning we would currently depend on either:

- SC members voting one another out (re: individual SC members)
- SC votes of no confidence (c.f. #472)

Would you rather see such a formal mechanism to retroactively retract/amend votes or recall individual delegates? If yes, what should this look like? If not, why not?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482#issuecomment-3394336617">link</a>)</summary>

Yes, I think there should be a clear mechanism for recall through a petition system managed by the EC. The EC would be responsible for collecting and verifying petitions, and once a sufficient threshold is met, the issue would move to a community-wide vote. I also support automatic recall elections for SC members who repeatedly miss meetings or remain inactive without valid justification, as accountability and participation are essential to maintaining trust and effectiveness within the SC.

### Who are "The Nix Community", and why? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/436))


One outcome of the NCA was the "Constitution", which advertises "Values". It falls short, however, of "constituting a community": it does not attempt to describe anything resembling a "membership predicate", a matter that was intensively discussed in the Governance Zulip. I'm interested in the candidates' reasoning and reflection about the community's composition, but here's also a few litmus tests:

- Are DetSys and Anduril "part of the community"?
- Is Jon Ringer "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Is srid "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Generally, how does moderation action affect "community membership"?
- Are former maintainers, who resigned in support of either of the two Open Letters, "part of the community"?
  - If they have not contributed back to the project since?
  - If they participate in discussions on Discourse or in Social Media?
  - If they contribute only to forks?
  - If they contribute to forks, but backport ad hoc?
- Are Lix, Snix, the Foundation, or the nix-community "part of the community"?
- Are NixCon Sponsors "part of the community"?
- Of participants of Nix-Offtopic and Discourse, are those, who do not "contribute" code, documentation, or decision-making, still "part of the community"?

Finally,

- Are people who disagree with the composition or the priorities of the "Values" part of the community?

I agree with @K900 that it does not make sense to rigidly define who “the community” is, since the term changes depending on context. Sometimes it refers to contributors, sometimes to users, and sometimes to those involved in governance or moderation. What matters more than strict boundaries is intent and engagement. People who contribute in good faith, help others, and share in the ecosystem’s growth are part of the community in a meaningful sense. That being said I do not think companies themselves are part of the community, but the individuals within them can be if they engage transparently and align with the community’s values. Overall though the focus should be on shared values rather than strict definitions.

### How do you want to proceed with sponsorship policy? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/342))


Last year, one of the most important questions to people running for SC was sponsorship policy, in particular regarding MIC companies. Since then, there were some efforts on the SC side to draft a comprehensive sponsorship policy, and they also started approving/denying sponsors directly, without delegation to NixCon team.

Do you feel like SC taking on this job is adequate in the long run, or do you see it as a temporary measure? What are your next steps on pursuing a sponsorship policy?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/342#issuecomment-3394273498">link</a>)</summary>

I would like to see a clear and transparent sponsorship policy established that defines acceptable and unacceptable partnerships, with the Steering Committee maintaining the authority to approve or deny sponsors. This ensures accountability and alignment with community values. Personally speaking though, I would push to disallow sponsorships from gambling companies and any organizations affiliated with the military-industrial complex.

### How are you going to interact with Lix? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/283))


Lix is now a major part of the ecosystem, providing a non-commercial, production-ready alternative to Nix. It falls outside of governance power of SC, but coordination with it is of paramount importance for Nix development, security patching, and stability of Nixpkgs (as there have been numerous occasions where Lix has fixed a crucial bug that was preventing Nixpkgs work, while Nix hasn't). Historically, there has been hostility towards Lix and running it on NixOS Community infra.

How do you plan to structure your communication with Lix Project?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/283#issuecomment-3394212663">link</a>)</summary>

I would engage with Lix cordially and constructively, recognizing its key role in the broader Nix ecosystem. Coordination between Nix, Lix, and related projects like Snix is vital for stability, security, and long-term technical alignment. Ideally, both Lix and Snix should have the same level of accessibility and communication with the Steering Committee as the current C++ Nix implementation. I would also like to see progress toward a formal Nix language specification to ensure interoperability and clarity across all implementations.

### How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197))


There is an [ongoing](https://discourse.nixos.org/search?q=Determinate%20Nix%20%23links%20in%3Atitle%20order%3Alatest) conflict between Determinate Systems and parts of the community. Some aspects of this, such as the "Nix the trademark" are likely things for the [foundation](https://github.com/nixos/foundation) to deal with.

However, Determinate Systems is *part of the community* as well, so this conflict also has aspects internal to the Nix community.

How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197#issuecomment-3356688495">link</a>)</summary>

I completely agree with @cafkafk points here, and would like to add an important dimension that has so far been left unaddressed:

The current Steering Committee has not properly investigated the alleged misconduct and misappropriation of resources entrusted to the Nix Foundation by Equinix, which were allegedly used by Determinate Systems in some unknown capacity. If elected, I will actively push for a thorough investigation into what exactly happened, how it happened, and why it was allowed to happen without transparency or accountability.

In addition, I believe it is crucial to address conflicts of interest head-on. Specifically, Eelco’s role within the Nix team is in direct conflict with his ties to Determinate Systems. To protect the community and the project’s integrity, I would advocate for his removal from the Nix team and for instituting a clear, enforceable Conflict of Interest (CoI) policy that applies to all members of the Nix team.

Without strong governance reforms and accountability mechanisms, these structural issues will keep recurring. The SC must not only focus on fostering (via delegation) the technical direction of Nix, but also ensure trust, transparency, and fairness in how leadership interacts with commercial entities and entrusted resources.

### How should the SC deal with people in the org chart not respecting their authority? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/491))


This question is based on a question from the previous year: https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114
> **Title: What's the best way for the steering committee to deal with inaction or being ignored?**
> One of the main ways in which the previous Nix governance has been criticized is for ignoring or being inactive in the face of community protests and concerns.[1](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#user-content-fn-1-be51383cd9081764e2d5d66461ad8100)
> 
> Let's suppose that the steering committee is now responsive to the community... but when the steering committee asks for or directs action, that request is ignored, de-prioritized, or litigated by the relevant parties.
> 
> How would you as a single SC member deal with this? How would you ask for your fellow steering committee members to act as a group?
>
> [1]: I'm not interested in rehashing or re-litigating these specific cases or people involved; please do not do so in your answer. [↩](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#user-content-fnref-1-be51383cd9081764e2d5d66461ad8100)

I would like to specifically add that the party in question might escalate the matter into the court of public opinion.

In the answers from the previous year there was a very clear dividing line among candidates about not only using explicit powers granted by the constitution, versus using activism.

Would you advocate for the SC using activism proactively?
Would you advocate for the SC using activism once a matter is moved into the court of public opinion?
How do you think the SC should react to activism?
At what point should the SC concede to activist pressures?

Adding to that footnote, I also don't mean to say this is hat happened recently or want to litigate specific recent events, I'm interested in other candidates general view on these kinds of issues.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/491#issuecomment-3394368858">link</a>)</summary>

I agree with @cafkafk here. With being involved with activism myself the fact that there is activism from the community is a sign that something deeper in governance isn’t working as it should. The SC shouldn’t ignore it or act defensively but listen, reflect, and respond transparently. The goal isn’t to “concede to pressure” or whatever but to understand the root cause and rebuild trust through accountability and dialogue. I believe when governance is aligned with the community, activism becomes collaboration rather than confrontation.

### What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to community and Foundation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337))


(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/34 from 2024 election)

What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to the community? Should they be linked on the homepage? If so, should they be compelled to comply with the Foundation's code of conduct? Should we attempt to convert these communities into official spaces (if so, at what point)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337#issuecomment-3394253526">link</a>)</summary>

I believe any community spaces promoted on official Nix platforms should meet clear standards, including adherence to the Foundation’s Code of Conduct and a baseline level of moderation and safety. This ensures that all linked spaces reflect the values and expectations of the wider Nix community. At the same time, if there is interest and feasibility, I would support promoting some of these unofficial spaces, such as Discord or Reddit, to official status provided they align with our governance and community guidelines.

### How are you going to resolve S3 cache situation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/336))


S3 cache size continues to rise. AWS still pays the bills for it, but this part of infra is something that might need a look.

Latest updates on the topic that I could find were from about a year ago on the Discourse:

https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-06-06-re-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-6/46617
https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-07-10-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-7/48821

My understanding is that it's a complicated topic, where a lot of technical decisions need to be made, and Foundation needs to get a lot of talks with various potential partners, and this needs to be coordinated. Binary cache is a center piece of the infra, so its future needs to be well-secured; do you have any concrete steps in mind on how to proceed? Maybe coordinating with someone doing software archiving?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/336#issuecomment-3394249092">link</a>)</summary>

I would work with the newly formed Nixpkgs Core Team, the Infrastructure Team, and AWS to discuss sustainable long-term solutions for the S3 cache situation. This should include evaluating storage optimization strategies, cost-sharing options, and better automation for managing cache growth. In the long run, I want to see the cache become less reliant on corporate sponsorships and move toward a more self-sufficient, community-driven model.

### How can contributing to Nix-the-implementation be made easier? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196))


It has repeatedly been mentioned in the past, that contributing to [Nix](https://github.com/nixos/nix) is hard.

What are the reasons for this from your perspective and how can this be improved?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196#issuecomment-3356540758">link</a>)</summary>

I agree with much of what @pluiedev and @crertel have said. The barriers to contributing to the Nix implementation are both technical and social. The C++ codebase is extremely difficult to approach due to its age, complexity, and inconsistent patterns. This makes it hard for new contributors to meaningfully engage, especially when paired with the long-standing bottlenecks in PR reviews and on-boarding.

In addition to streamlining contribution processes and focusing on maintenance and cleanup, I believe we should actively work with alternative implementations like Snix and Lix to move toward an official, community-maintained Nix specification. This would not only reduce fragmentation, but also make the semantics of Nix clearer and more portable across implementations. A shared spec can empower contributors to experiment and contribute meaningfully without needing to dive into the legacy C++ codebase.

I would also support working with the Nix team to gradually integrate Rust and/or Zig into the codebase where appropriate. This could help lower the barrier to entry for contributors and open the door to a more modern, maintainable, and approachable implementation over time.

### Should electoral alliances/coalitions count as conflicts of interest? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/479))


Related to #470.

It has been brought to my attention that several candidates are interested in forming electoral coalitions[^1] where candidates agree to vote for each other in time for the election. This could significantly change the result of the election, especially if coalitions decide to formalize which candidates they choose to vote for and which they do not, and if many members of the same coalition are elected to office, their shared interests could dominate the SC. In spite of this, there are currently no rules in place that will require electoral coalition/alliance status to be disclosed in each candidate's statement. 

Do you think participation in coalitions and alliances *has to be* disclosed? If not, do you think they *should* be disclosed?

[^1]: To be clear, *informal* alignments such as friendships do not count here — whether *those* should be counted as CoIs deserve a different issue altogether.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/479#issuecomment-3394327368">link</a>)</summary>

I think formal voting blocks or coordinated alliances should be disclosed, as they can influence election outcomes and create potential conflicts of interest. However, cross-endorsements or informal alignments based on shared values or mutual respect do not need to be disclosed in the same way. I believe transparency matters most when there is coordinated strategy or collective decision-making that could affect fairness or representation in the election. For example, I do believe that [this](https://nixos-sc.pages.dev/) should be disclosed as a formal alliance if the candidates endorsed here were involved in any way on the making of the website.

### How are you planning to pursue a trademark? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/340))


A trademark is direly needed, as there are many commercial projects who use "Nix" in their name for marketing purposes, sometimes confusingly. However, the trademark rules have to be reasonable for downstream users, and put clear guidelines. Furthermore, there might be conflicts if the trademark policy doesn't match a company's path. Additionally, it will require a clear set of guidelines between what each of Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS project constitutes, and how much "Nix" they share (possibly with renaming?)

How do you plan to handle this?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/340#issuecomment-3394263638">link</a>)</summary>

I agree that a trademark is urgently needed to protect the Nix name and reduce confusion caused by its use in unrelated or commercial projects. I would work closely with the Board to expedite the trademark process as much as possible while ensuring it is done transparently and responsibly. Once established, we (The SC alongside the Board) should publish clear, reasonable guidelines for trademark use that respect both community projects and downstream users. The goal should be to safeguard the Nix identity without restricting legitimate community-driven efforts that align with our values.
</details>

### If you were in a previous SC, how would you vote on public issues? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/281))


There were several decisions made by previous SC in response to community conflicts. They set an important benchmark to gauge candidate's decision-making. Those questions are:

    Allow Anduril to keep publishing jobs on Discourse?
    Replace PolyMC with Prism Launcher?
    What should be the policy on MIC participation?
    What should be the policy for telemetry?

What additional initiatives would you raise?

c.f. #256 

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/281#issuecomment-3394198796">link</a>)</summary>

If I were in a previous Steering Committee, I would have voted to disallow Anduril from publishing jobs, as companies tied to weapons development conflict with the community’s values and long-term direction. I would not have replaced PolyMC with Prism Launcher, since such decisions should be community-led and based on transparent criteria rather than reactionary measures. I support banning MIC participation in governance to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure decisions reflect the community’s ethics, not corporate influence. For telemetry, I would allow it only if it is clearly disclosed, fully optional, and easy for users to opt out, maintaining transparency and user control at all times. Optimally though the last two questions would be delegated to various teams notably the newly formed Nixpkgs Core Team.
</details>

### How do you want to structure communication with Determinate Systems? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/341))


The title might seem excessively direct. However, last year, there was a question on MIC policy and Anduril ban. Since then, SC has enforced a ban on Anduril job posting. Anduril has been a very controversial company for the wide community; I feel like it's fitting to ask about another controversial company, and how to interact with it.

What are the problems you see with communication between Determinate Systems and NixOS Community? Are there concrete suggestions you have, or would like to propose? What other areas of work (Nix improvements, trademark policy, etc.) do you feel prevent healthy collaboration?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/341#issuecomment-3394269657">link</a>)</summary>

I believe communication with Determinate Systems should be handled transparently and within clearly defined boundaries, especially regarding influence over Nix governance and branding. Finalizing and enforcing a Nix trademark policy would help formalize those boundaries and ensures no single company or individual holds disproportionate control. Given the conflicts of interest that have arisen, I would also ask Eelco to recuse himself from Nix governance matters and step down from the Nix team. This would help rebuild trust, clarify roles, and allow collaboration with Determinate Systems to continue on a professional and transparent basis without compromising the independence and openness of the Nix community.
</details>

### What are your thoughts on documentation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/339))


Documentation is often cited as being lackluster, incomplete, or confusing. Personally, I disagree; I've seen many improvements to documentation over the years, and I think it has come a long way. Still, those improvements don't address the core issue for why documentation *feels* lackluster.

IMO, the issue is because the boundaries between projects are not clear. A new NixOS user will look at the NixOS manual for help: but really, they are using Nix+Nixpkgs+NixOS stack. For a beginner, it is not clear why there would be three manuals, and where the boundaries lie, and which manual they need (especially when interacting with a layering violation). This provides a frustrating experience, where despite the information being abundant, it is not at all discoverable in a relevant fashion.

Is this something that you are concerned with? What do you want to do with it? Direct more resources into cross-cutting documentation projects, like nix.dev or wiki.nixos.org ? Work on clearer project boundaries? Attempt to bridge documentation?

I am curious to hear your thoughts.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/339#issuecomment-3394259783">link</a>)</summary>

I think we should significantly strengthen our documentation and make it a top priority for the project. Clear, accessible, and well-structured documentation is essential for both newcomers and experienced contributors. I would like to see more resources dedicated to improving existing manuals, consolidating fragmented content, and expanding the official wiki into a central, well-maintained knowledge hub. This should include better coordination across projects like nix.dev and wiki.nixos.org to ensure consistency, clarity, and easier discoverability. Strong documentation, I believe, is one of the best long-term investments we can make in the health and accessibility of the Nix ecosystem.
</details>

### How are you planning to reconcile conflicts between SC and Nix team? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/285))


Nix is a central piece of the ecosystem, and Nix team holds authority over it. Additionally, many Nix team members are a long-time, trusted community members, making them overwhelmingly more likely to be elected. One of the purposes of SC is to coordinate different teams; this poses a clear conflict of interest, when someone is in both Nix team and SC, as that person's interests as an SC member and Nix team member are not necessarily aligned.

How is such a conflict of interest planned to be addressed, or resolved?

c.f. #258 

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/285#issuecomment-3394226187">link</a>)</summary>

I would like to see the Nix team adopt a clear and enforceable Conflict of Interest policy that is also publicly disclosed. While this would start with the Nix team due to its central role in the ecosystem, I would aim to expand similar standards to other teams as needed. I would also recommend periodically shuffling or rotating Nix team membership to bring in new perspectives, reduce stagnation, and ensure no single group holds disproportionate influence over core project directions.
</details>

### What is your view on licensing? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/338))


Right now, the ecosystem is very split between permissive licenses (MIT), copyleft-ish licenses (LGLP, MPL), and copyleft licenses (GPL). This signifies a wider disagreement between people on what community is, and what to expect.

Licenses are by no means perfect, but they signify intention and direction. They are like a COC: adopting one doesn't instantly solve all of your problems (nor is expected to), but it shows where the project is heading. This has a lot of consequences later down the line. It could be argued that Nixpkgs being MIT-licensed is a reason why there are so many companies hanging around it; it could likewise be argued that the reason DetSys hasn't been more successful with their "downstream distribution" has to do with LGPL.

What is your view on licensing? Are you planning to put out guidelines for licensing official and community projects? Pursue relicensing various projects? 

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/338#issuecomment-3394256352">link</a>)</summary>

I am fine with both permissive and copyleft licenses, as each serves different goals and communities within the ecosystem. However, I personally prefer a stronger copyleft approach and would like to see more projects under our organization adopt licenses that prioritize user freedom and long-term community benefit. I would support policies that encourage free software principles and favor copyleft licensing for official projects.
</details>

### How are you going to reform SC? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/284))


To me, SC results were disappointing. Despite the community having clearly cast their votes, not much of substance was achieved in a year. This is indicative of a "committee" situation: where consensus is required to make any decisions. This poses an existential threat to the effectiveness of SC, as SC is meant to represent very diverse parts of the community, that often have conflicting interests. Achieving consensus in such a case is a pipe dream.

That's why SC members need a lot more autonomy, to be able to make decisions on their own (overriden by majority, if significant opposition arises) and not get blocked by achieving impossible consensus. This is the entire purpose of SC, as consensus-driven decisions were made with RFCs, and ran into all the same issues.

Considering this, how would you reform the SC to allow for more individual action and autonomy?

I agree that the Steering Committee needs to evolve to enable more individual action while maintaining accountability and community trust. My platform emphasizes clearer structures, transparency, and reducing bottlenecks in governance, so I would support giving SC members defined areas of responsibility where they can act autonomously, subject to review or override by majority if needed. I would also advocate for stricter conflict of interest checks to ensure decisions are made in the community’s best interest. In the long term, I’d like to see the Nix governance model move toward a more sociocracy and liquid-democracy inspired structure.

### What is a "competing implementation", and should being involved in one constitute a conflict of interest? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/456))


(This is a little targeted, though everyone is welcome to chime in with their thoughts, of course.)

In https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3354754312 you said that you're worried about the current definition of "conflict of interest" not including "being involved in competing implementations and communities, social media groups, country, military status, and so forth".

What is a "competing implementation" or "competing community" to you? What level of involvement would you consider significant enough to constitute CoI? What decisions are you expecting the SC to make where this CoI becomes an issue?

Also, once again, as a litmus test, would any of these people be considered to have a CoI?
- a Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc team member
- a Determinate Systems employee
- a Snix/Tvix/Lix/etc contributor
- a contibutor to both NixOS/nix and Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc
- a person present in Tvix/Snix/Lix/etc discussion spaces
- an Auxolotl/Ekala/etc contributor
- a contributor to both NixOS/nixpkgs and Ekala/Auxolotl/etc
- a person present in Auxolotl/Ekala/etc discussion spaces

Also, can you maybe name examples of social media groups or countries that would be considered to have a CoI, and why/when?

Yes, but I do not think that being involved in a competing implementation is necessarily a bad thing. Cross-project collaboration often brings valuable perspectives and innovation. However, I take a maximalist approach to conflicts of interest, so I believe all relevant affiliations should be clearly stated, including involvement in internal Nix teams.

<summary>Currently sitting SC members running for reelection: why did you vote the way you did on a vote of no confidence on 2025-09-30? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/452">link</a>)</summary>

Today, [a reply by @jtojnar](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) on the whistleblowing post mentioned that the Steering Committee held a vote of no confidence today, 30 September 2025.

> Vote of no confidence of the entire SC 2025-09-30 (failed 3/6)
> * Ericson2314: -1
> * Gabriella439: +1
> * jtojnar: +1
> * roberth: -1
> * tomberek: -1
> * winterqt: +1

A "yes" vote to a vote of no confidence implies that the individual does not have trust in the SC. A "no" vote implies that there is still some trust left.

Why did you vote the way that you did?

<summary>If you are re-elected, how did you vote on previous issues? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/282">link</a>)</summary>

In a similar vein to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/256, opinions on past incidents present an important benchmark to judge candidate's moral and practical compass. This is even more important for existing SC members. SC has some out as a single front to make coordinated statements; I believe that to be an important mistake, that allows SC members to hide behind a bureaucratic body and avoid any kind of accountability. I believe it to be highly unfair. For that reason, I would like to know the historical votes of SC members on various issues.
