### Conflict of interest disclosure

List any potential conflicts of interest ([what is
that?](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/blob/main/doc/conflict-of-interest.md))

- Technical Lead at alugha GmbH (multilingual video platform and dubbing
tool suite from Germany, uses Nix for CI/CD and some internal
applications)

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

Over the past three years, Nix and NixOS have become an irreplaceable
part of my personal machine setups and my development workflows. They
have fundamentally changed how I think about building and shipping
software and how I operate servers. To enable people to work on the
pillars of NixOS and Nix with as little hurdles as possible, we need a
stable, decisive NixOS Foundation. That is a cause to which I would
happily contribute my time and resources.

#### What I have done

- For close to two years now, I am organising the local NixOS meetup for
the German Rhine-Neckar region in Mannheim and Heidelberg to help people
in our community connect, exchange ideas and learn.
- As a more recent member of the nixpkgs committer team (as of April
2025), I'm trying to help new-ish contributors with their onboarding
into our world by offering them the possibility of a direct exchange,
whenever I feel that the traditional PR feedback loop may become too
frustrating for them.

#### What I will do

- Help push forward reforms in the commit bit delegation process based
on input from people of both sides of it, as well as from the
experiences other Linux distributions have made (like I previously lined
out in a [Discourse
thread](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/regarding-the-nixpkgs-committers-interest-list/63332)).
- Encourage stronger exchange between our upstream Nix implementation
and the different FOSS Nix implementations that have become an integral
part of our community. I am of the firm believe that their existence is
a net positive for our ecosystem and that our upstream implementation
can only benefit from their input.
- Increase SC transparency by advocating for public logs of SC meetings
as long as they do not contain confidential information, as well as
offering to be a direct contact person for concerns and questions.
- Investigate how the SC can encourage diversity in foundation-financed
events such as NixCon or sprints. The demographics at these events are
not representative of the many people I got to know and become friends
with in this community.
