## Conflict of interest disclosure

I am employed by Anduril.

## Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I believe this project has the power to change the world. It has certainly changed my life. I want to give back and see this project prosper.

### What I have done

* I have been involved in the NixOS project since 2021.
* I contribute to Nixpkgs.
* I contribute to documentation in Nixpkgs and on nix.dev.
* I lead the Marketing Team and have made contributions to branding, surveys, and the NixOS homepage, and I have aided the Foundation in pursuit of a trademark.
* I co-founded and co-organize the SoCal Nix Users Group, and have advised others on how to start their own Nix Users Group.
* I co-organized the Reproducible and Immutable Software track at SCaLE 21x, NixCon NA 2024, Planet Nix 2025, and Nix Vegas 2025.
* I gave talks at NixCon 2022, NixCon NA 2024, and NixCon 2025.

### What I will do

I believe when you are entrusted with authority, it is your duty to communicate and act transparently. When the Marketing Team reformed itself at the beginning of the year, I advocated and generally took it upon myself to take and publish minutes from our meetings. Excluding any sensitive or confidential information, I would advocate for the same as a member of the Steering Committee. If the Rust Leadership Council, the Python Steering Council, and the NixOS Marketing Team can publish minutes, then the Steering Committee can as well.

I believe that the Steering Committee should delegate as much responsibility to teams as is necessary for those teams to act in their role and perform their duties. With that said, with delegated authority also comes a duty to communicate and act transparently. For core teams such as Nixpkgs Core, Security, Infrastructure, Marketing, Moderation, and Nix, there should be solid ongoing communication and those teams should be keeping minutes or some other tangible form of records that are traceable. If the Steering Committee is meant to empower teams, then those teams, in kind, should demonstrate accountability to the community by documenting their decisions, articulating their reasoning, and making their work visible. This reciprocal relationship ensures that authority flows outward while trust and legitimacy flow back in, creating a governance model that is both distributed and resilient.

Fostering a healthy and thriving community is essential so that people are motivated to contribute and feel valued in doing so. I believe that the long-term success of the project is tied to both the evolution of the software and the resilience of the community that supports it.
