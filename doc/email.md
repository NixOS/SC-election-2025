# How to check, set or change your email address

If your email address in [`eligible.csv`](../eligible.csv) is missing or wrong,
you won't be able to vote.

Please set your email before [the deadline](../README.md#timeline).

To set or update your voter email address:
1. Set or change the email address for your entry by editing the file,
   e.g. [directly on GitHub](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/edit/main/eligible.csv)
2. Make a PR with the edit, which will be automatically merged if you only update your email.
