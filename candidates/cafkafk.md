### Conflict of interest disclosure:

I'm the primary maintainer and creator of the [eza][eza-link] project, and have
an ongoing sponsorship from [warp.dev][warp.dev-link].

I'm currently working at a Health Tech Startup called [VitVio][vitvio-link] as a
Lead Software Engineer. Our goal is to reduce waiting lists of operating rooms
--- everywhere. NixOS helps us with that.

I was an infrastructure developer at [DBC Digital][dbc-digital], doing critical
infrastructure at a national scale for Danish libraries. DBC has been the second
largest financial contributor to the NixOS foundation since 2020 according to
[open collective][dbc-open-collective]. DBC Digital is owned by [KL][kl] (the
national association for the municipalities of Denmark).

### Motivation to be on the steering Committee

#### What I have done

In last year's election, I finish as the first runner-up for the seven available
seats. 

I've been a leading voice in the [Military sponsorship
discussions][military-sponsorships]. I’ve created Nix projects such as:
- [Nix Weather][nix-weather], a tool for debugging cache availability of Nix
  packages.
- [Rime][rime], a FOSS alternative to flakehub, adding semantic versioning to
  flake inputs.
- [NixLang Wiki][nixlang-wiki], a former alternative to the unmaintained
  nixos.wiki (now deprecated in favor of wiki.nixos.org).
- [NixOS Landscape][nixos-landscape], a project to map Nix Adjacent projects and
  increase discoverability.

I’m a former maintainer of [Morph][morph], [Kubernixos][kubernixos], and a
maintainer of  [Wharfix][wharfix]. In nixpkgs, I helped reintroducing Guix to
NixOS, and worked to modernize the Kubernetes module.

I frequent the [NixOS Copenhagen User Group][nixos-ug] and the [Copenhagen Rust
Community][cph-rs], and assisted as an organizer at times. I attend NixCon every
year.

I'm a Lead Software Developer, a hiring manager, the leader of an open source
project with 17k+ stars, and someone that has been involved passionately in the
NixOS community for over 5 years. I've always been willing to actually [get shit
done][eza-rises-from-the-ashes], and take the hard stand on issues.

[eza-rises-from-the-ashes]: https://youtu.be/4CYinVmTUYA?t=468

As the primary maintainer of eza, I’ve driven contentious change, and I’m well
acquainted and unbothered by the friction that comes from leading. My track
record in Nix shows the same. I’ve pushed hard for transparency around
sponsorships NixCon 2023, NixCon 2024 NA, and conflicts of interest of board and
steering committee members. I’ve defended gender statistics in the annual
survey, and called out diversity issues. 

Finally, I've been willing to stand against some of the biggest companies in the
community when their interests went against those of the project.

After years of work, I believe we are on the right track.

### What I will do

I have much I want to do. Instead of trying to do everything, here is where I
will start.

#### *Process*

I've read the [Steering Committee retrospective from
Gabriella][gabriella-retrospective]. To me, the challenges raised here are of
primary concern.

Currently, the steering committee isn't leading the community. And if the final
instance required for decisive action in the project is indescisive, then what's
the point? 

So that's my primary concern. The steering committee should actually get things
done.

I think we can solve this. 

[gabriella-retrospective]: https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html

#### *Transparency*

Meeting notes and employers of board and steering committee memeber should be
made public - to the extend possible. There should be public logs of both.

Everything should default to being documented in public, including decisions and
how members vote.

If the steering committee finds certain subjects too sensitive, they may be
redacted, but even then, the fact that a vote or discussion took place should be
documented. Who voted for and against - even if we can't say for what - should
be written down for everyone to see.

The steering committee must become auditable and accountable to everyone in the
project. 

#### *Unblocking Adoption*

Flakes aren't unstable. That's mainly a naming convention at this point. It is a
major disadvantage for the project, and the official installer adds friction.

Flakes should be installed by default. Defaults should be sane. 

Many decisions in the project aren't made based on what's best for the project,
but where measures to alleviate immediate harm. Now those same measures have
themselves become harmful.

By engaging with the community, and listening for places where their colleagues
are blocked or choosing alternatives to official tools, I'll correct any
blockers with the steering committee and community, and ensure we become the
best choice.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think Nix is a paradigm shift in how we do computers, and I want to convince
the rest of the world of that. I want to work with Nix for the rest of my
career, and for that to become a reality, I'm running for the steering committee
again.
