### Conflict of interest disclosure

I work for the [Flying Circus](https://flyingcircus.io) as System Engineer. We use Nix and NixOS as technology for our hosting platform. We host and sponsor discourse.nixos.org, but I am not working on that currently.

I do most of my contributions to Nix projects in my free time. Contributions I do for work are always marked by being through the work repo forks.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

#### What I have done

I have been involved in the Nix community since 2021 and have been using Nix and NixOS since then on all devices that support it.

Currently, I am release manager for NixOS and Nixpkgs 25.05 and 25.11. I'm passionate about improving processes, working together with people and trying to achieve the best result for the project. I tried and still try to make the release smooth and a good experience, both for our contributors and for users – a thing that "just works" and nothing that people worry about.

I am among the signatories of "NixOS users against MIC sponsorship" (2024).

#### What I will do

In my opinion, the Steering Committee should not decide over the heads of the teams in most cases. My goal is to work together with the teams, discuss ideas and strategies and work out a solution together. Decisions over the heads of teams always create tension and often worse solutions. The teams are experts in their fields, I am not always one and neither is every other SC member. If these discussions don't lead to a solution, the SC needs to decide though. Especially for technical aspects, I see this as a last resort. As the SC is elected by community, it can and should oversee the teams on a meta level in context of the general community to strengthen cohesion.

I want to support the teams and the whole community in their work by providing them with an environment that enables them. This includes addressing the conflicts in the community – my goal is to have a strong community, even though this might be hard.

As an open-source community, I think it's important to not depend on a few large companies. This has proven to be a problem quite often in the history. I want to work on keeping the balance in favor of the community.

I would like to work on a culture of openness in the SC: decisions should include a justification, a description of the proceedings, and the voting results. I think this helps people to understand the work of a SC and also shows that the members of it are not trying to work against the community. The principle here is: it is better to communicate more than less.

This said, I have some personal ideas, that I would like to discuss with the teams:

- Reduce Nixpkgs package set by removing long unmaintained (upstream or within Nixpkgs) and/or broken packages
- Establish a NixLang spec (my personal working title) for the Nix language and CLI and a corresponding implementation working group: I think it's valuable to have multiple implementations and a good way to further develop NixLang and make it better
