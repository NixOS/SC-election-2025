## Conflict of interest disclosure

I'm a french public servant, working at CNRS. Software maintenance has been my main role there since 2017, and I don't expect this to change anytime soon.

## Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I really just want to work on packaging stuff, and to provide reliable systems to my family, friends, and colleagues. And the world. I am thrilled to be in a community with many highly skilled peers for this task. But I observe social issues hurting them and diverting them from their full potential, so my conscience tell me that I should be working on that first.

### What I have done

- Work in nixpkgs, mostly on scientific software. I'm especially familiar with the Python & CMake ecosystems.

- Served in the moderation team for a bit more than a year.

### What I will do

My priority is to protect the community. For this I'll follow Elinor Ostrom and claim that we need clear boundaries on who is or not part of that community. I've seen too many total strangers only coming to heat up political debates, or "just asking questions" and wreak havoc.

> Individuals gain trust and status by doing the work.

I'll also push on improving internal communication and transparency between SC and teams. It must be clear that SC itself is:

> subject to high[est] expectation for their conduct.

And finally, I'll work on the creation of a tooling team. Those tool we have to help us work on packaging are awesome. Let's celebrate, grow, and cherish them !
