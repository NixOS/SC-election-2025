### Conflict of interest disclosure

While I am not currently employed and therefore unaffiliated with any for-profit organizations or companies that are involved with (or even necessarily aware of) Nix or would benefit from my SC candidacy, I am personal friends with fellow candidates and nominees Scrumplex and getchoo. While it is undeniable that due to my personal connections I could be more inclined to be in concordance with them compared to others within the Committee, I do not think that this will compromise my integrity and independence as a candidate, and I'll always be forward with my own opinions even if it puts me at odds with my friends. 


### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

#### What I have done

Before this election I've had a relatively low profile in the wider Nix community, serving mostly as a maintainer of a dozen packages in Nixpkgs, and as an occasional reviewer specializing in reviewing beginner contributions to Nixpkgs. (To this day I have not gotten committer access, mostly because I think I'm not yet proficient enough in Nix to accept that responsibility.) Other than that, I've made a few contributions to nix-community repositories like nixos-hardware, Home Manager, plasma-manager, etc.

Outside of Nix, people mostly know me from [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) as both an active developer/maintainer, but also as a community manager that helps to keep our discussion space productive and answering any questions I'm able to answer. On top of that, I  have a background in community moderation, community management, team coordination and conflict de-escalation, especially with an intersectional perspective that can help organizations avoid common blind spots that can be hard to notice for tech communities dominated mostly by cisgender, male, white, Euro-American members.

#### What I will do

One of my key objectives is for the Steering Committee to refocus on its original purpose: to steer and lead other teams within the NixOS Foundation, making sure that they stay within compliance of our community values, conduct and boundaries, while leaving the day-to-day execution at the discretion of the individual teams. As demonstrated in the recent fallout between the moderation team and the incumbent Steering Committee, it is clear that SC overreach has a negative impact on the cohesion of our team members, and I am going to prioritize establishing the SC as a cordial advisor and observer, not just for the moderation team but also for other teams as well, by limiting the scope of the SC's responsibilities and allowing each team to enjoy more autonomy as long as they serve our community in accordance to our values and principles — the SC should not override teams' decisions unless they are found to be blatantly against community values and/or unconstitutional.

Reforming the SC and dismantling the SC's perceived "shadowiness" and opacity is also very important for me. To ensure accountability and transparency in this organization, I am in favor of publicly releasing all meeting minutes, agendas, individual voting results and decisions, and restricting censorship to information that involves personal data or may otherwise compromise someone's identity, safety and confidentiality, or other information that we are not allowed to disclose due to legal reasons. The SC should also publicly post progress of our goals and initiatives, and to be candid and genuine in our reports. While the SC is designated to hold other teams accountable, it should also be accountable by the myriad members of the community.

Another part of steering is to establish goals and initiatives for other teams, and allocate the resources needed to achieve them. A few efforts I am particularly concerned with are (in no particular order):

*   Infrastructure: In an increasingly geopolitically divided world, we need to make sure that the infrastructure behind Nix is robust against actions by any state to ensure our goal of maintaining a global community. To that end, I will push for talks with the infrastructure team to explore solutions to mitigate single points of failure currently present in the ecosystem (e.g. the reliance on GitHub and the S3 cache), as well as potentially enlisting outside help to broaden the global reach of the Nix project, like volunteer groups outside of Europe and North America who are dedicated to ensure Nix's availability;
*   Nix (the package manager): Currently Nix is in a very uncertain position with no clear goals, in contrast to Lix's emphasis on stability and long-term health of the project, or Determinate Nix's commitment to stabilize and propel experimental features like Flakes to reach general availability. It is also in a perpetual state of gridlock (and even arguably neglect) as 400+ PRs and over 3000 issues stretch the Nix team's resources increasingly thin. As the SC we should steer the Nix team to define what the short- and long-term goals of Nix are; encourage the Nix team to focus more on empowering the community to contribute to Nix instead of doing everything on their own (e.g. improving documentation, refactoring the codebase, identify sprintable or contribution-friendly issues, etc.); and strike conversations with the Lix team and Determinate Systems in formulating a common basis of Nix implementations so that both users and developers can use software and packages that target the same specification.
*   Defusing tensions: It's telling by how many Q&A issues for nominees this year (and also last year) pertain to clashes within the community, that we as a community are in a historically very difficult place to strive for togetherness and forgiveness among one another. However, I think that it is impossible to achieve true peace and reconciliation if we, as the SC, simply ignore the discontent that lingers in many of our community members and the wounds that have not healed since 2023. As interpersonal and interorganizational conflicts can be very complex and require as much impartiality as there could be, I propose that we formally adopt a first-party mediation program that any community member can use to discreetly and safely resolve historical conflicts. Additionally, the SC should also begin talks with organizations that have had conflicts with the NixOS Foundation in the past (e.g. Lix, Determinate Systems) to find more common ground than things to disagree on. Only through open, sincere dialog can we manage to move forward as a community, instead of walking around in circles of drama.
*   Cultural gatherings and events: I believe that one of the most effective ways to build a community is to gather in person; this year's NixCon, for example, broke attendance records on top of last year's already resounding success, and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience there and made lots of new friends along the way. Hence in my opinion the SC should encourage more in-person exchanges and events (such as Nix user group meetups, Nix talks in other conferences, etc.) that allow members of the community to partake in dialog that are less affected by the amplifying, radicalizing and distorting effects of online discourse. The SC should also encourage more editions of NixCon outside of Europe — a common complaint I have heard from many attendees from Asia and the Americas is that Europe is physically too far away and prohibitively expensive to reach. I would especially push for a future NixCon (or another event similar in budget) in East or Southeast Asia, as there are many folks that are vitally important to the community but are underrepresented in Nix conferences.
*   Relationships with corporations: The Nix project currently does not own the Nix trademark which is a legally unsound position given increasing corporate interest in adopting and relying on Nix. It also does not have a formal sponsorship policy, which would concern potential sponsors about whether their sponsorships would be accepted (see also [Mitchell Hashimoto's blog post](https://mitchellh.com/writing/advice-for-tech-nonprofits) on the common problems faced by interested sponsors and donors of tech non-profits). Both problems need to be fixed as soon as possible given mounting costs and Nix's gradual mainstream adoption.


## Q&A

### Should the SC vote for confidence instead of for no-confidence? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472))


The [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#full-reelections) reads:

> A simple majority within the SC may call a reelection of the entire SC based on perceived loss of confidence.

This can lead to a 3-3 deadlock as we [currently](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) [see](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/6). In this deadlock, neither the reelection, nor any majority vote can pass - the SC is unable to function.

**In many legislatures, this is flipped into a vote of confidence that must pass to avoid a re-election.** This would have the same results for a full SC, but avoid situations like the current 3-3 deadlock.

Do you support amending the constitution accordingly?

Honestly I'm not sure why we didn't have a clause like that in the constitution to begin with. You'd think that if the SC doesn't have the confidence of >=50% of its members it would be acting without majority consent, right? Hindsight is perhaps 20/20 here...

It's also important the SC be capable of governing and managing its own affairs instead of delegating that task to other organs. If an SC that couldn't even manage to figure out how to manage itself is elected, we will all be in deep, *deep* trouble.

### How would you handle an SC member joining Anduril? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190))


Recently, current SC member Tom Bereknyei took a new job at Anduril. After parts of the community [criticized](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971) the SC for not communicating this publicly, the SC gave a [statement](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/statement-on-a-steering-committee-member-joining-anduril/69007).

As an SC member, how would you like the SC to handle such a situation in the future?

*Please focus on the community aspects and be specific in what actions should be taken in such a scenario. This is not the place to discuss your opinion about the [MIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex).*

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190#issuecomment-3351865285">link</a>)</summary>

I agree that being an Anduril employee per se is not necessarily the problem ­— we even have current Anduril employees running for this very (re-)election, and there isn't any new public outrage about that. After all, no matter how much one dislikes or even hates Anduril, if an Anduril employee is elected to the SC through perfectly democratic means, in Tom's own words last night, it is ["representative of a portion of the community"](https://matrix.to/#/!6oudZq5zJjAyrxL2uY:0upti.me/$ZOg8X34Q5bNhnk9jN26F37CVOHSuPw2wGFHH3kSva90?via=laas.fr&via=matrix.org&via=node.marinchik.ink). 

Instead, what we need to do as members of the SC is to consider the impact of our personal choices, and especially if said choices are very likely to challenge the power and trust that had been bestowed on us, we need to publicly disclose them and vow that despite our new affiliations, we will stand by our elected platform and remain impartial and unswayed by interest groups.

I then disagree with Philip's assessment that requiring disclosure of CoI changes would be a *particular* exception that would only raise more questions — after all, nothing about this is particular to Anduril or Tom or anyone else. When an electorate elects the SC, they judge the candidate based on their stated conflicts of interests and policy goals; when I was doing research last night about Tom's candidacy last year, there were scantly any mentions of Anduril at all, only that he had military experience and had a more "unique perspective" of the controversy.

To people who are not acquaintances with Tom, that is a *very* different status compared to suddenly becoming a direct Anduril employee. **This is why disclosing any change to CoIs is important** — so that people don't feel like they are betrayed, [no matter how you claim that your platform and ideals have always been the same](https://matrix.to/#/!6oudZq5zJjAyrxL2uY:0upti.me/$AG6Ub51EiDh1OLc3lbZpQfvFKgpAyVzRgrP8pGndudE?via=laas.fr&via=matrix.org&via=node.marinchik.ink). To a lot of people, *this very CoI is a dealbreaker* and would undoubtedly undermine their trust in any given candidate, and there's nothing stopping other CoIs to become dealbreakers, too. (Granted, that would be the last thing I'd like to see happening to our already-fractured community.) K900 puts it really succinctly here — it is the **strong commitment of intent** that counts.

### Course of action for nixos.wiki ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/474))

Agreed that there doesn't seem to be anything the SC could do other than reaching out and hoping that the owner will agree to joining the wider organization, but it has been shown time and time again that that is unlikely to happen. The nuclear option is that we could ask the Board to enforce our trademark on Nix/NixOS/Nixpkgs/etc. and legally force nixos.wiki to rename itself or be taken down, but the Board has to agree to and act on that first.

### Should Nix transition away from GitHub to a self-hosted git forge? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/326))


(copy of https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/18 from the 2024 election)

Do you believe Nix should move away from GitHub and instead host its independent Git forge? If so, what are the benefits and challenges of such a transition, and how would you approach this shift if it were to happen?

If you already answered last year, it would probably totally be fine to just copy that answer.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/326#issuecomment-3342091637">link</a>)</summary>

See also my earlier lengthy spiel over at https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/409110#pullrequestreview-2864799032, which covers many similar points.

My position is that we should absolutely look into a viable alternative for GitHub — it doesn't have to replace all existing GitHub-based infrastructure now (or ever), but the fact that we have a single point of failure in the form of an increasingly unreliable and untrustworthy Git forge is worrying to me.

**Why is GitHub unreliable?** For starters, users cannot access GitHub from countries that are either a) sanctioned by the United States government (e.g. Cuba, Iran, Syria) or b) intentionally blocking GitHub for not complying with censorship laws (e.g. China). As a Chinese person I have to confront point b) on a **daily basis** that many of us in the Global West do not at all realize — I have to set up elaborate proxy networks and intermediate relay servers just to be able to work on anything Nix, because all official Nix projects are hosted on GitHub and **nowhere else**. The Chinese Great Firewall is also extremely inconsistent when it comes to GitHub — in my own personal experience, the sub-megabyte-per-second speeds I have to endure regularly sometimes turn into tens-of-kilobytes-per-second speeds, or sometimes it's simply zero. Sometimes it's not even the government that blocks GitHub, [but the other way around](https://www.githubstatus.com/incidents/jfvgcls9swln).

In case this is not clear: **it is not acceptable** that our community infrastructure is off-limits to many of us around the world like this. The ability to hack on official Nix projects at the moment is very much precious for many of us (even core contributors like @Aleksanaa and @wegank), and not having to experience this is a great sign of privilege.

**Why is GitHub untrustworthy?** Following former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke's resignation and [the announcement](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/github-will-be-folded-into-microsoft-proper-as-ceo-steps-down/) that GitHub will cease to be an independent subsidiary, and become a direct subordinate of Microsoft's CoreAI division, it is clear to me that GitHub has lost any and all semblance of autonomy after 7 years of the Microsoft buyout. First Copilot, then [LLM-generated issues](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-19-creating-issues-with-copilot-on-github-com-is-in-public-preview/), and then more and more changes that are designed to maximize MSFT's shareholder profitability at the cost of the open-source community are sure to follow. It's not a question of what we will get in return of all of this — the answer is that we are sitting ducks to any arbitrary change to GitHub's Terms of Service or usage plans. **We lack sovereignty over all of our infrastructure.** GitHub is freely able to change whatever they want about their platform, and we can do nothing about but watch and accept it as it happens, no matter how controversial or detrimental it is to us, without any escape plan in place in case something turns sour.

Again, we don't *have* to switch off GitHub entirely. It's very likely that we never would: too much of our current structure is based on GitHub working as it is, especially with services like GitHub Actions, and moving to any other options entirely would be a massive logistics challenge on top of a discoverability issue — GitHub, for better or worse, is still the "default" code forge for the vast majority of open-source work out there. It's just that I'd like an option to simultaneously use something else.

As for what would be a great alternative, I personally don't have a strong opinion. GitLab is a very well-established option with self-hosting capabilities and a mature CI system; Gitea/Forgejo are also popular, lightweight options that don't suffer from GitLab's (IMO) obtuse design; [Tangled](https://tangled.org) might also be a good federated option, but it and its CI system are too early in development for a behemoth like Nixpkgs.

But what I do think that needs to happen is that we need to start having this conversation, and think about our options. We cannot just brush this aside and say that GitHub is "good enough" with good conscience.

### Should the size of the SC be reduced to 5 members? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/265))


In https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html, current SC member Gabriella argues that 7 members are too many for the SC to operate efficiently and effectively.

I am also hesitant to call for the SC to be reduced to 5 members, for pretty much all the reasons listed above. If 7 members are truly too many, we can either amend the constitution during the next SC term or raise this issue again for the next election and see if the sentiment shifts.

### How would you treat SC members with completely opposite political leanings? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/489))


As the title suggests, if some SC members have completely different political affiliations and governance ideas than you, and often disagree with you on decision-making, how would you treat them? How would you ensure that you fulfill your responsibilities?

More seriously, if you find that the faction you represent is not the majority in the SC, what will you do?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/489#issuecomment-3368105923">link</a>)</summary>

As we are a global community with members from all walks of life and with potentially very different cultural, social and political experiences, it is impossible to avoid situations where someone else's viewpoints clash with one's own.

Instead of seeing that as a problem and perceiving all dissenters as political enemies, we should embrace it as a demonstration of the diversity we have within our community, and we need to cooperate with each other and stay on cordial terms regardless of our differences, *as long as both parties' conduct does not violate community rules and values*.

On my part, **I welcome cooperation, discussions and exchanges with all candidates and members of the electorate**. If we have differences in opinion, let's talk them out — I'll be happy to spend considerable amounts of time finding common ground instead of ideological differences. If someone disagrees with me, I expect them to address me directly and we can iron it out, instead of withholding objections discreetly until the moment it counts. 

**Dialogue is the first step towards reconciliation and mending the many wounds our community has sustained.** I am willing to do whatever it takes in support of its implementation.

### Community participant behaviour regarding moderation decisions ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/477))


**Scenario**: While being suspended by a decision from the moderation team, a suspended community participant mass mails other community participants about a community matter. The recipients did not all have an existing relationship, or a good-standing relationship with the suspended individual.

**Question**: What do you think of this behaviour? How do you characterize this in regard of the expected conduct, and the values of this community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/477#issuecomment-3362445154">link</a>)</summary>

Regarding this specific event, I'll be honest — I almost fell for it since I wanted to have a good faith discussion with this person about my candidacy (and their objections to it), but I was luckily reminded that doing so would likely help them circumvent their community suspension. As soon as I realized this, I withdrew my participation and told them that I will only be okay to appear in public with them after their ban had elapsed (which is right after the election). This is a major oversight on my part, and I apologize for ever thinking that it is okay for me to interact with them under these circumstances.

In the future, I think we need to better define exactly what suspended members are or are not allowed to do while their suspension is in effect. In this case given that this person only targeted incoming SC candidates, **and specifically wanted us to interact with them before election starts** (while their suspension is in **full effect**), I doubt their intentions are at all pure here. It would be okay if they only reached out to a few acquaintances of theirs, but I cannot read this situation with any amount of good faith, ~~and would even like to ask the Election Committee if this constitutes electoral fraud~~. We don't want to prohibit *all* interactions between community members and suspended members since that would be a) physically impossible and b) sociologically impossible, but we need to be more vigilant in case somebody tries to pull off a stunt like this.

EDIT: The EC has privately explained that they do not have the power to disqualify a candidate solely based on their interactions with suspended community members, and only an SC supermajority may do so. However, in order to stay on the safe side and to keep my own independence and integrity as a candidate, I am choosing not to publicly interact with this person for the duration of the election.

### How transparent should the SC be? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407))


In a [blog post](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html), resigned SC member @Gabriella439 recommended future SCs to increase transparency toward the community. (A different recommendation there, regarding SC size, is the subject of #265.)

In particular, the argument for this went (non-header emphasis mine):

> **Poor self-organization and internal policies/procedures**

[...]

> I think one of the big mistakes we made was that we insisted on **“speaking with one voice”**, meaning that we could not make any meaningful external statements or comments without getting majority approval from the committee (something we had difficulty with on the regular). This is why the committee remained largely silent or slow-to-respond on a large number of issues.

> This problem got bad enough that at some point many members began to break the wall of silence by commenting in an unofficial capacity on high-profile issues so that outsiders would get some visibility into what was going on instead of waiting for us to completely the slow process of gathering enough consensus and votes.

> Another internal policy that I believe was counter-productive was **not disclosing the final votes** on various issues or requiring individual signatories on public statements. Had we done this it would have likely broken a lot of internal stalemates and filibusters if all committee members were held publicly accountable for their policy positions (and therefore subject to public pressure).

> It would have also helped with another issue, which was:

> **Absenteeism**

> For various reasons (some justifiable, some not), at many points in time a large number of committee members would be unreachable, even during crucial junctures like ongoing controversy. This absenteeism was masked by the committee not publicizing that fact earlier. **If we had required all votes to be publicly recorded and all statements to require individual signatories** it would have exposed this absenteeism earlier (and led to quicker corrections).

As such, I would like to ask SC candidates: how do you regard the topic of SC transparency in light of @Gabriella439's recommendations, if not more generally? Further, how would you concretely enact these views in the SC, if elected?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407#issuecomment-3342111253">link</a>)</summary>

As a relative outsider before now, I haven't had many interactions with the SC, though the general feeling that I sensed from them was overwhelmingly *mystique* — a property you do **not** want to have from a body that holds all other bodies accountable. That is not to say that it is a shady cabal pulling the strings; the fact that it even looks like one is a perception we need to fix, especially when it isn't even the necessarily case in my albeit limited experience.

Prior to the election I had one encounter with the SC, which is when I objected to the addition of PolyMC to Nixpkgs and summoned the SC for their arbitration. I consider that encounter to have gone quite well — I was contacted directly and publicly by Gabriella to clarify a few details about the reasoning behind my objection, and I actually agreed with the SC's judgment in that instance and opted to not pursue my objections any further. This to me shows a fairly direct, open and transparent conduct that sits directly contrary to the perceived shadowyness of the organ — something that is apparently unfortunately not uniformly applied to all instances of SC actions, as shown by the mass resignation of moderators.

Ultimately, I think we need to uphold Gabriella's conduct as the common standard for all SC members. Information and feedback need to be be gathered publicly; the general reasoning of the body need to be published (though individual opinions may be withheld); and the organization needs to be seen as an accountable, trustworthy, impartial body that can, as the name implies, *steer* the rest of the community in the correct course. We cannot lead, if everyone is questioning: "who watches the watchperson?"

### Are you in any coalitions with other candidates? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/470))


Are you aligned with other candidates in e.g. a coalition? What is your coalition about, **broadly speaking**? (Please put the finer points of your coalition's answers into other relevant questions. This question is asking for coalitions to self-identify.)

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/470#issuecomment-3358056947">link</a>)</summary>

I personally do not believe in coalitions as I believe they may lead to a homogenization of views and cause further deadlocks in the SC when one coalition is pitted against the other (like what is happening right now, when 3 SC members ardently refuse to resign while 3 others ardently urge them to do that exact thing). I believe that remaining independent encourages more flexible and nuanced policymaking that leads to a less dysfunctional SC compared to the last one.

That said, I am interested in forming informal alliances between independent candidates that are interested in collaborating with me on my policy goals, or are generally interested in forming a more dynamic yet impartial SC. My contact details are all public, so feel free to reach out. I know my opinions can be very pointed at times, but I do believe I have way more ideas in common with others than how it first seems.

### If mods are cops, who should decide on punishments? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464))


Related to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428 and the ongoing discussion on discourse about the resignation of the moderation team: https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828

I’ve seen different metaphors for what moderators are supposed to be. Some say moderators are like cops (enforcing rules), others say they’re like paramedics (helping people in crisis).

But no one has made the case for moderators as _judges_. If moderators are indeed tasked with enforcing rules, who then plays the role of the judiciary in our governance model? Do you think mods alone should be able to decide on the punishment (especially lifetime bans)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464#issuecomment-3356070716">link</a>)</summary>

The way I see it is that moderators have free rein to take whatever measure it is necessary to make sure that the least amount of harm is being done as a result of interpersonal conflicts (and such I subscribe to the "paramedic" school of thought as you have described it), and in extreme cases that might involve removing troublemakers from the scene entirely, like after @mightyiam tried to repeatedly stir up a scene and get me disqualified from the election out of bigotry[^1]. It is the moderation team's discretion to come to those decisions and act upon them — the SC must not influence and interfere with moderator decisions, as again **we are not elected to moderate, but to lead**. Similarly, I would trust the moderation team to know when a permanent ban would be justified, but as the SC we should be extra vigilant about permanent bans due to the their severity.

Instead, we as the SC's role is like a court of appeals or even the supreme court in case that the moderation team steps out of the line and violates community values and conduct, say if hypothetically they decided to exclude a member from official spaces based on discriminatory criteria (gender, sexuality, race, religion, etc.). In that case the SC is to hold the moderation team accountable and either reverse/veto the decision, or call for the moderation team to be dissolved and choose a new one in its place. The whole reasoning process needs to be transparent and open, of course.

[^1]: This is, in fact, the moderation team's reasoning behind his ban. If you have a problem with that, I'm not the one you're looking for.

### Should community-related Conflicts of Interest be considered for the SC election? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192))


The [constitution explicitly mentions](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#conflict-of-interest-coi-balance) "employees of the same company or otherwise the same payer for Nix work" as *examples* of Conflicts of Interest for the constitution of the SC.

In the current SC, we had three members of the Nix team (Ericson2314, roberth, tomberek) and two members of the commit bit delegation team (jtojnar, winterqt), which arguably reduces diversity as well.

Should team-memberships in the community also be considered as Conflicts of Interest for the SC election? Why (not)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3367675474">link</a>)</summary>

I think a conflict of interest, by definition, means that two or more people have to be aligned in their interests, which in the case of teams like the Nix team is not necessarily true in every aspect except the common interest of their team — in Nix team's case that would obviously be Nix. By itself I don't think this is too problematic, unlike employment where financial incentives are much stronger and much more *binding* (see rhendric's answer for more elaboration on that) than the mere shared enthusiasm and skills that are required to be on a team.

So no, I don't think teams should count as CoIs.

### What is the goal of community moderation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428))


What, in your opinion, is the goal of community moderation?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428#issuecomment-3349202655">link</a>)</summary>

Contrary to the sitting SC, I do not believe that a universal, "objective" standard of moderation behavior exists, nor is it our responsibility to find or define one should it must exist. One common stated goal for moderation is to preserve "etiquette", but that word is intrinsically linked to culture, and in the context of the Global North, it depends on a set of codified social norms based on cisgender, male, White, European standards of politeness, which does not always universally apply and in fact have been frequently used to [silence minorities from other cultures and backgrounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing) that do not construe expected conduct in the same manner.

Instead of preserving "etiquette" or "civility", what I like to say is that the goal of moderation is to **prevent and ameliorate *harmful* conflicts**. Confrontations and disagreements will always occur no matter what you do, and so the focus should be on de-escalating emerging conflicts so that harm is less likely to be done, or when harm has already been done, try to mitigate and/or minimize its deleterious effects. In cases where someone intentionally instigates conflict (e.g. raising false accusations, propagating and escalating conflicts, trolling, baiting, hate speech, etc.) the moderation team should also be empowered to nip these attempts in their buds, since unlike harmful conflicts that arose out of initially amicable interactions, per their nature these are deliberate threats at our happiness, safety and unity, either for the whole community or for an individual.

What we need to do as the **Steering** Committee is to help find people who are willing to restore the collective health (or "sanity") of our Community, and empower them to fight against harmful conflicts in line with our community values and in a transparent, efficient and just manner. We should not micromanage them into doing what we want, since our job descriptions and titles do not fundamentally involve any form of moderation, and we are not elected on our ability to do so.

Instead, we are to function as guides and arbiters, who lay out the fundamental values, conduct, responsibilities and boundaries, and rule on whether any team has conformed to them; the exact methodology is the sole domain of those who actually perform day-to-day moderation functions. To borrow more from the "Steering" part of the name: no driver likes backseat drivers who constantly tell them which road to take, how much to step on the pedal or when to turn on the headlamps — instead, we are the front seat passenger who watches closely for any violations against traffic regulations that could put us all in danger.

### How would you act on the moderation team's call to SC candidates? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/390))


When a large part of the moderation team [stepped down](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828) they asked for:

> **We call on the SC candidates:** to commit to implementing a Constitution reform that will require transparency and accountability from the SC, with teams like technical steering and moderation providing a counterbalance.

How would you act as a member of the next SC in this matter?

My hope is that it wouldn't be necessary for the Constitution to force the SC to be transparent and accountable — the fact that that should even be noted as an explicit requirement of the SC is a failing of the incumbent committee. I'd like to see if a re-elected SC composed of candidates who are vocally committed to transparency and accountability would be able to reform itself first, and if that does not occur, then a referendum vote of no-confidence should be initiated by other teams to call for a re-election to the SC since they cannot be trusted with power in the first place.

> with teams like technical steering and moderation providing a counterbalance.

Ideally instead of a few significant teams being in charge of keeping the SC in check, we would have a mechanism where *any* team could peacefully initiate a public complaint against the SC, and if an agreement cannot be met, teams could collaborate together to initiate a vote of no-confidence that requires an absolute majority to re-elect the SC, or the SC could dissolve the moderation team with a supermajority as mentioned above. We could even formally organize a body that consists of all other teams within the NixOS Foundation (a Congress of sorts?) which can assemble to discuss SC decisions and be able to push back against perceived SC tyranny.

### Stance on specific case of statements made by external actors ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/485))


The following was authored by @jaen but I'm posting it on their behalf because they cannot and I would like answers to it as well. The title of the issue was written by me.

---

The recent SC turmoil had been commented on outside the community in various venues. In particular, I'd like to draw attention to this [Twitter thread](https://xcancel.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1972037286192992320) where certain individuals talk about _“get[ting] these nut jobs out”_ and that _“[M]aybe @<!-- -->PalmerLuckey can help turn the ship around.”_ While the Anduril founder does not acknowledge those proposals directly, he says this:

> The good news is that Anduril will keep using Nix to build ever more powerful weapons for American dominance regardless of what the fringe "community" people say.

The question is, what is your stance on this thread — is it a nothingburger, or an indication of existential threat to community governance and self-sovereignity — and what steps, if any, do you plan to take to insulate the project against the threat, should it it materialise into something more concrete than online bickering.

And as a corollary to that, what does Nix governance and self-sovereignity means for you, do you feel it’s an important aspect for the SC to work towards and what would your be general policy to handle potential threats stemming from external actors looking to control the project to their own ends. Consider what limits — if any — you would seek to put on such a threat actor, how — if at all — could that extend to functions community members associated with them could perform at a maintainer and/or governance levels, for example to ensure the threat actor cannot pressure them into acting against the project's best interests.

I don't know if he is trying to sound like a cartoonish, mustache-twirling supervillain or is he serious when he is saying that. I think it would be worse if he truly meant it. Regardless of your political leanings, I think we can all agree that explicit calls to encourage "American dominance" at the cost of *literally every other country* violates our value of ["People come first"](https://nixos.org/values/#community-values-people), especially considering the fact that we are a ***global*** community with undeniable European origins. **The things Palmer has called for here are without a doubt contrary to our worldview, our values and our principles.**

That being said, there is not really anything we can do as the SC. Palmer is his own person and entitled to his freedom of speech (no matter how wrong or harmful that may be), and as long as he isn't touting his guns within official spaces then we do not have jurisdiction over him. Furthermore, decisions to actually sanction him can only be undertaken by the moderation team when it comes to community interactions, and by the Board when it comes to fiscal, financial or sponsorship-related issues — we as the SC *under normal circumstances* can only urge these other bodies to consider a suspension or sanction if needed, or we can deem their decisions to be against community values and conduct if that were to be the case.

### What should happen in the event of an SC member resigning early? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481))


The SC is currently elected by proportional representation, which seeks to reflect the preferences of its voters.
However, over this initial SC term we have seen multiple early resignations, potentially making what remains of the SC less representative of its voter base, if not also affecting [decision-making capabilities](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/some-procedural-clarifications-on-the-constitution/70278).

Now, there may be alternate ways to deal with scenarios involving early retirement, including going over the original votes to recalculate what alternate candidate might best represent this part of the electorate, or (eventually) even calling new elections.

As a candidate to the body in charge of our constitution, how would you ideally see these cases handled?

<details>

DISCLAIMER: I have no background in political science and I don't know if this is a sound system. I am welcome to all sorts of feedback (including ones that simply say this is a very bad idea). Regardless, this is what I have at the moment.

I've been thinking about this lately and I think one solution would be to make the Election Committee keep a list of 2–3 runner-up candidates who nearly made into the top 7. They would serve as the backup crew should one of the SC members step down due to personal reasons. Crucially to avoid any tactical resignation maneuvers, *neither the incumbent SC nor the backup candidates themselves know this status* — instead in case of a resignation, the EC that elected the incumbent SC should be consulted and allowed to appoint the first person remaining in the backup crew.

For example, if one person had to resign from the SC, the 8th place candidate automatically succeeds them. If a second person resigns, then the 9th place succeeds them. If a third person resigns, then the 10th. I think if yet a fourth person resigns, you already lost half of the original SC and at that point something is *very* wrong, and we should call for a full re-election.

For me, this solution both honors the electorate's wishes and also keeps the continuity of the SC for the most part if only 1–2 members resign. It would be very problematic if more than 2 members resign, but if we are put into that place to begin with then something is again very wrong.

### politics of tech and governing values ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487))


Whereas the existing Nix projects have licenses already, one popular adage states technology is not neutral - perhaps increasingly obviously so, as the impact of technology continues to grow.

As such, zooming out a bit, one of the topics the community has seen different takes on seems whether we should govern by certain values, as exemplified by actions such as the earlier open letter against MIC sponsorships, a sentiment that seemed represented among contributors, or 'keep politics out', a sentiment that has seemed represented more at e.g. the NixOS sub-reddit.

As a candidate, where do you stand on this? What values should we expect you to hold?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487#issuecomment-3367658709">link</a>)</summary>

While it is often wished for politics to matter less and less within our Community, unfortunately I don't think avoiding politics is a desirable or feasible objective. After all, our world is an increasingly polarized and political environment, and that Nix itself could not have been made without the [free software movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement) — a *socio-economical-political* movement that is ideologically rooted in the once-radical anti-capitalist idea from the 1970s that software should be free for all to use, modify and study without paying for any patent fees or other monetary hurdles. No matter how much one wants to avoid it, politics is always here and is crucial to running an organization successfully — we can only choose how to *address* it.

Instead, what I think we need to do is to foster a **healthy atmosphere of productive politics**, not the kind of antagonistic, shouting-and-yelling politics we have seen thus far both within and without our Community. We need to be able to peacefully discuss inherently political matters (like e.g. sponsorships and corporate support) without devolving into unproductive, harmful, ad hominem attacks.

I have a few proposals of reaching that direction: 
1. **Reduce the reliance on open letters to achieve organizational change.** The *need* for open letters came from the prior cases of **administerial inaction/inefficiency**, that causes the public to feel neglected and unaccounted for. This will hopefully be ameliorated by the SC publishing meeting minutes and ensuring full, individual transparency for every decision we make, so that the public won't feel that they aren't being heard.
2. **Establish an official conflict de-escalation channel.** This is basically the same idea as zimbatm's [NixOS Mediation](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/introducing-nixos-mediation-a-new-conflict-resolution-service/61614) service where two parties wishing to make amends after e.g. political conflicts could find a trusted liaison to overcome their differences. The SC's role would be in establishing this service and appointing the right person as the intermediary, hopefully one with significant community trust and conflict de-escalation experience.
3. **Empower the mod team to make more nuanced decisions.** Currently, if you check the moderation team's moderation logs, most of the infractions recorded are punished via suspensions or permanent bans. As the SC if we want to restore an air of cooperation and productivity we should investigate a solution with the mod team that would diversify the moderation outcomes while also making sure our community values have not been infringed upon. We should not make people *who are operating under good faith* constantly fear severe repercussion for their words — after all, to err is human; to forgive, divine.

### Voter mechanisms to recall individual candidates ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482))


Over the past days, there have been [multiple](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971/) [calls](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/) for individual SC candidates to step down, or even calling for a [full reelection](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/).

Current procedures have yet to take into account such desires, meaning we would currently depend on either:

- SC members voting one another out (re: individual SC members)
- SC votes of no confidence (c.f. #472)

Would you rather see such a formal mechanism to retroactively retract/amend votes or recall individual delegates? If yes, what should this look like? If not, why not?

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/482#issuecomment-3367556233">link</a>)</summary>

If we completely ignore the implications here (that the entire composition of the SC could be changed on a whim and destabilize the entire organization), I think even just from a logistics perspective it would be very difficult to track and tally each request, especially if they are directed against a specific member. 

I think a public referendum and/or a vote of confidence are already sufficient mechanisms for people to voice their disapproval for incumbent SC members, though we should make them clear that they are *not* to be ordinary occurrences, and that once you vote for a candidate you are in most instances willing to trust their judgement and good faith for the duration of their term.

### Who are "The Nix Community", and why? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/436))


One outcome of the NCA was the "Constitution", which advertises "Values". It falls short, however, of "constituting a community": it does not attempt to describe anything resembling a "membership predicate", a matter that was intensively discussed in the Governance Zulip. I'm interested in the candidates' reasoning and reflection about the community's composition, but here's also a few litmus tests:

- Are DetSys and Anduril "part of the community"?
- Is Jon Ringer "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Is srid "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Generally, how does moderation action affect "community membership"?
- Are former maintainers, who resigned in support of either of the two Open Letters, "part of the community"?
  - If they have not contributed back to the project since?
  - If they participate in discussions on Discourse or in Social Media?
  - If they contribute only to forks?
  - If they contribute to forks, but backport ad hoc?
- Are Lix, Snix, the Foundation, or the nix-community "part of the community"?
- Are NixCon Sponsors "part of the community"?
- Of participants of Nix-Offtopic and Discourse, are those, who do not "contribute" code, documentation, or decision-making, still "part of the community"?

Finally,

- Are people who disagree with the composition or the priorities of the "Values" part of the community?

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/436#issuecomment-3351433040">link</a>)</summary>

First of all, what an excellent question. In [my answer to #337](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337#issuecomment-3342101095) I defined the "Nix Community" as the set of all people who are interested in Nix. It is a very broad definition, but in my mind we need to have a sufficiently wide base, so that we can better understand where our boundaries lie. Nix is at its core a democratic and open community, so any pre-existing membership criteria would be unfair exclusivity IMO. Instead, being "part of the Community" in my mind is a matter of self-identification and there's little we can do to interfere with it.

Like it or not, corporations like Determinate Systems and Anduril definitely do constitute "part of the Community", because they use Nix, engage with Nix, and even contribute to Nix, and we do not have any rights to forbid them from doing so. However, it is the responsibility of the moderation team to determine whether to place any restrictions on their presence within official spaces, due to the controversy and discomfort that may endanger and disturb large swaths of Community members. (Remember, the SC is not elected based on our ability to moderate, but for our ability to lead.)

Jon Ringer (and srid for that matter) definitely were "parts of the Community", although whether they still are falls on them to answer. Again, whether they should be sanctioned is the responsibility of the moderation team. Contrary to popular belief, moderation does not *exclude* or *remove* members from a Community: their responsibility is to prevent harm to the wider public, should the words and actions of a member violate common conduct, which may be conducted in numerous ways that do not involve the complete silencing of a Community member (in fact, that should only be the final option should no other options prove viable, as is with Jon Ringer's case).

In that sense, they are more *ostracized* and isolated rather than completely severed from the Community, since especially for someone so prolific like Jon Ringer, it's impossible to erase their contributions to our Community — what we can do is to prevent more people being hurt due to his views and actions. This is true for former maintainers as well: the hundreds of thousands of commits collectively made under their names cannot be ignored, covered up or forgotten; what we can do is to respect their wishes and welcome back to the Community if they so wish.

Whether Lix, Snix, etc. decide to stay within the umbrella Nix Community, decide to spawn their own sub-Community, or leave entirely like Guix to become their own project, is a matter of their own destiny. We cannot coerce them to stay with Nix if they opt to otherwise, but we can do is trying to remain on good terms with them so that there is no need for them to split off. I think those projects (especially Lix) also realize that their existence hinges upon Nixpkgs being maintained as well, so hopefully we can find more commonalities than differences there.

I'm a bit tired of writing long paragraphs now so here is a quick round of the remaining questions:

> Are NixCon Sponsors "part of the community"?

Yes, very much so! They care about Nix and are even willing to give us money and resources to fund people to talk about Nix and connect with each other about Nix, who otherwise might not be able to do so.

> Of participants of Nix-Offtopic and Discourse, are those, who do not "contribute" code, documentation, or decision-making, still "part of the community"?

Absolutely yes still.

> Are people who disagree with the composition or the priorities of the "Values" part of the community?

If they disagree with the composition or values of our Community, then there's a very high chance they have already left us to begin with. If they refuse to leave then it is again up to the moderation team to judge whether their beliefs threaten the safety and unity of the rest of the Community, and all the SC is responsible for is to assess whether the moderation team performed *their* duty in a way that complies with our values and code of conduct. For these matters it is especially important for the SC to remain vigilant but otherwise non-interventionist as a conflict of interest is usually involved.

### How do you want to proceed with sponsorship policy? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/342))


Last year, one of the most important questions to people running for SC was sponsorship policy, in particular regarding MIC companies. Since then, there were some efforts on the SC side to draft a comprehensive sponsorship policy, and they also started approving/denying sponsors directly, without delegation to NixCon team.

Do you feel like SC taking on this job is adequate in the long run, or do you see it as a temporary measure? What are your next steps on pursuing a sponsorship policy?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/342#issuecomment-3342166058">link</a>)</summary>

The problem with a fixed policy is that they're inherently *reactive* to public concerns instead of being proactive against sponsors who are against our values. Therefore, I would opt more for an approach that outlines the general expectations of a sponsor (e.g. actions are not against Nix community values & CoC) and lists specific examples of sponsors that are *personae non gratae* — key example being Anduril, but I can also see how nation-state actors could cause outrage as well depending on the country they're affiliated with. 

Honestly, there aren't enough prior art to base a comprehensive policy off of — to my knowledge Anduril is the first major sponsor to elicit controversy like this — so we might be stuck to a more case law-ish system for a while. 

However, I do have to say that we need to emphasize the role of *responsible reporting* here: we need to encourage the public to share any concerns directly to the SC instead of dumping it out in the open and causing public outrage. **We do not need more drama.** Ideally, a responsible, transparent, accountable, trustworthy SC would detail its reasoning and judgment to avoid an Anduril-esque situation again.

### How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197))


There is an [ongoing](https://discourse.nixos.org/search?q=Determinate%20Nix%20%23links%20in%3Atitle%20order%3Alatest) conflict between Determinate Systems and parts of the community. Some aspects of this, such as the "Nix the trademark" are likely things for the [foundation](https://github.com/nixos/foundation) to deal with.

However, Determinate Systems is *part of the community* as well, so this conflict also has aspects internal to the Nix community.

How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197#issuecomment-3355212918">link</a>)</summary>

While I do share the concerns of Determinate Systems' EEE strategy (which I think is made *incredibly* loud and clear by dropping upstream Nix support), I don't really think as the SC there's anything we can realistically do to directly sanction DetSys that does not constitute overreach. The matter of the Nix/NixOS/Nixpkgs trademark is a Board matter (and we should definitely expedite that), and whether to allow DetSys to advertise in community spaces is a Mod team matter. In lieu of evidence that Christina is currently withholding — and I am open to changing my opinion when that evidence is eventually disclosed — I do not believe we have any grounds to formally begin sanctioning DetSys; not with a significant chunk of the Nix team being DetSys employees themselves.

That being said, what we *can* do as the SC is to counter the proprietarization of Nix projects by propelling our own [free, libre, open-source installer](https://github.com/NixOS/experimental-nix-installer), by making [our own Nix implementation](https://github.com/NixOS/nix) more [robust](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196), and to keep on pushing Nixpkgs/NixOS as a unique, one-of-a-kind jewel that cannot be overtaken by proprietary substitutes. In other words, instead of forcing DetSys to slow down or back off, we need to **pick up the pace** ourselves first.

I would like to specifically add that the party in question might escalate the matter into the court of public opinion.

In the answers from the previous year there was a very clear dividing line among candidates about not only using explicit powers granted by the constitution, versus using activism.

Would you advocate for the SC using activism proactively?
Would you advocate for the SC using activism once a matter is moved into the court of public opinion?
How do you think the SC should react to activism?
At what point should the SC concede to activist pressures?

Adding to that footnote, I also don't mean to say this is hat happened recently or want to litigate specific recent events, I'm interested in other candidates general view on these kinds of issues.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/491#issuecomment-3368916811">link</a>)</summary>

In my view, activism should only be used when the SC or other accountable bodies have shown that they suffer from decision paralysis or procedural deadlocks that prevent them from responding *at all* to the needs of the community. When we have a functional, accountable, responsive, transparent SC, activism should scarcely ever be necessary. 

While people often use activism in the real world to push for changes that the masses of government could not meaningfully address, Nix is a considerably smaller community with a much smaller governance body, where each member in power is required to be publicly reachable, and many have time to respond to most inquiries. Therefore, **I do not see a reason why instigation should be preferred over peaceful dialogue and transparent disclosure.** If a majority of people in a position of power (e.g. the mod team or the Board) condemns the SC's actions, we should have a mechanism to allow them to act on them, such as the Rust option. Otherwise, we shouldn't allow ourselves to be thrown into turmoil again just because of public outrage.

> What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to the community? 

"The community" is a sort of nebulous word, so let's define it now. A community is a set of people, and the Nix Community is the set of people interested in Nix. Therefore, people who are interested in Nix and are using unofficial channels are still part of the community and should be regarded as such. One cannot exclude them from this definition just because they happen to be using unofficially moderated platforms.

> Should they be linked on the homepage? If so, should they be compelled to comply with the Foundation's code of conduct?

Yes, and yes. Unlike the issue with platforms, we do expect everyone who is part of the community to share a baseline of decorum that we have outlined in the CoC. Without abiding to the CoC, users cannot expect the same base level of safety that are on par with officially moderated spaces. I do think that the moderation team should have the right to review unofficial spaces, and suspend our implicit endorsement of them (in the form of being linked on the website or through other means) should they be found to violate the CoC.

Let's consider a hypothetical example for easier comprehension. Assume there is a circle of Nix users who regularly call for violence against certain members of the wider community (in violation of the CoC where violence and threats of violence are strictly prohibited), and let's call it V. V primarily bases its exchanges (including the violent threats) in a Discord server. The moderation team, upon learning of V and has decided that it is in violation of the CoC, should be able to sanction V and prevent it from being affiliated with or connected to official spaces.

However, the moderation team should also allow another Discord server of CoC-compliant Nix users (let's call it D) to be connected to official spaces. Although D is not supervised directly by the moderation team itself, if it fits the expectations laid out by the CoC there should be nothing that forbids them from being part of our Community.

> Should we attempt to convert these communities into official spaces (if so, at what point)?

Unofficial spaces that wish to become "official" (e.g. be managed or supervised by the NixOS Foundation and its organs) should always actively *request* so. We should not make any attempts at assimilating communities and expanding our control against their will.

### How can contributing to Nix-the-implementation be made easier? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196))


It has repeatedly been mentioned in the past, that contributing to [Nix](https://github.com/nixos/nix) is hard.

What are the reasons for this from your perspective and how can this be improved?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/196#issuecomment-3342119024">link</a>)</summary>

1. The foundations of Nix have been in place since many of us (including yours truly) have been *alive*. Over the last twenty years there's going to be layers of cruft that never get turned over due to the sheer size and history of the project. This is an unavoidable fact that IMO cannot be meaningfully addressed without rewriting the entire thing from the ground up like Snix, which would take valuable time from the already resource-constrained Nix team.

2. Let's be honest, modern C++ is one hot dumpster fire of a language. It can even scarcely be called one single language. The CppNix codebase is a hodgepodge of callbacks, coroutines, futures, async/await, optionals, null pointers, references, lambdas, type inference, templates, concepts, hopes, dreams, despair, frustration, all rolled into one incomprehensible package. With two decades of incremental changes and drastic language evolutions, it's extremely difficult to even orientate oneself within the codebase if one does not have a full grasp of every single C++ feature added within the last 20 years. Imagine studying C++98 at school, using C++14 at work, and having to deal with C++20 `co_await`s littered around in the codebase without ever having an up-to-date understanding of how each and every feature interacts with each other. This can be alleviated if we only use a subset of C++ features, but as things currently stand at least it is sheer madness.

3. C++ just isn't appealing to new developers anymore, especially in face of competition in languages like Rust or Zig, both of whom do not share the legacy cruft of C++. There's a legitimate point to be made behind the meme-y "rewrite it in Rust" campaigns.

4. As a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, it's quite hard to get CppNix PRs merged in the first place since the Nix team is in my view perpetually shortstaffed and working on more and more fundamental and experimental features instead of consolidating the foundation and taking incremental bugfixes. This dissuades new contributors from submitting new PRs to CppNix in the first place, and prevents them from understanding the codebase enough to take up maintenance of the codebase (or even just a sliver of it). 

Unlike the first three problems, I think this is something the Nix team could meaningfully address. Consolidate the codebase so that everything runs on a rocksolid foundation. Eagerly review and merge PRs from new contributors and foster them to become recurring contributors and even maintainers. Establish tangible, reachable goals for people who are interested in helping to improve CppNix, instead of doing everything on their own. If you make it, they will come.

### Should electoral alliances/coalitions count as conflicts of interest? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/479))


Related to #470.

It has been brought to my attention that several candidates are interested in forming electoral coalitions[^1] where candidates agree to vote for each other in time for the election. This could significantly change the result of the election, especially if coalitions decide to formalize which candidates they choose to vote for and which they do not, and if many members of the same coalition are elected to office, their shared interests could dominate the SC. In spite of this, there are currently no rules in place that will require electoral coalition/alliance status to be disclosed in each candidate's statement. 

Do you think participation in coalitions and alliances *has to be* disclosed? If not, do you think they *should* be disclosed?

[^1]: To be clear, *informal* alignments such as friendships do not count here — whether *those* should be counted as CoIs deserve a different issue altogether.

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/479#issuecomment-3367590941">link</a>)</summary>

As an [outspokenly independent candidate](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/470#issuecomment-3358056947) who shares the sentiment against factionalism and policy cementation, I do think that formal coalitions/joint tickets/etc. should be counted as conflicts of interest due to the concerns I have listed in the question body.

I think that the electorate should be at least informed of these ties, and be prepared that candidates in the same coalition may vote very similarly in SC decisions and may cause the SC to lean towards a common set of opinions shared between coalition members and therefore compromise its independence and impartiality.

### If you were in a previous SC, how would you vote on public issues? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/281))


There were several decisions made by previous SC in response to community conflicts. They set an important benchmark to gauge candidate's decision-making. Those questions are:

    Allow Anduril to keep publishing jobs on Discourse?
    Replace PolyMC with Prism Launcher?
    What should be the policy on MIC participation?
    What should be the policy for telemetry?

What additional initiatives would you raise?

<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/281#issuecomment-3342127476">link</a>)</summary>

> Allow Anduril to keep publishing jobs on Discourse?

No. Many, many people who are (or were) part of this community have explicitly stated (myself included) that allowing a company, that directly uses Nix to produce weapons that kill innocent civilians and allow the government to continue mass surveillance upon its people, to continue its involvement in any form within the Nix Community cannot be tolerated.

Allowing Anduril to post jobs in *any* of our official spaces would be a massive middle finger to what remains of our community, and an utter disdain to those who have already left. I do not want to see our community in this situation, ever.

> Replace PolyMC with Prism Launcher?

Hey — I was the one who even escalated this to the SC to begin with, although it's less replacing PolyMC and more if we should allow PolyMC to co-exist with Prism Launcher. Upon further reflection I actually agree with the decision the SC took: even though the behavior shown by the upstream community directly violates our CoC, the package itself does not. It would be very different if say, PolyMC itself contains a transphobic or racist message. 

Despite all that, I would still call for some sort of advisory mechanism for items that are included within the Nix ecosystem, whose upstream may not perfectly align with our values, and that our inclusion of them within the ecosystem does not constitute an endorsement of any kind.

> What should be the policy on MIC participation?
> What should be the policy for telemetry?

I agree with Niklas — these are open-ended questions that deserve more conversation on their own.

### What are your thoughts on documentation? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/339))


Documentation is often cited as being lackluster, incomplete, or confusing. Personally, I disagree; I've seen many improvements to documentation over the years, and I think it has come a long way. Still, those improvements don't address the core issue for why documentation *feels* lackluster.

IMO, the issue is because the boundaries between projects are not clear. A new NixOS user will look at the NixOS manual for help: but really, they are using Nix+Nixpkgs+NixOS stack. For a beginner, it is not clear why there would be three manuals, and where the boundaries lie, and which manual they need (especially when interacting with a layering violation). This provides a frustrating experience, where despite the information being abundant, it is not at all discoverable in a relevant fashion.

Is this something that you are concerned with? What do you want to do with it? Direct more resources into cross-cutting documentation projects, like nix.dev or wiki.nixos.org ? Work on clearer project boundaries? Attempt to bridge documentation?

I am curious to hear your thoughts.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/339#issuecomment-3351602662">link</a>)</summary>

In my mind, Nix suffers from two kinds of documentation issues at once: on one hand, there's little documentation for the cutting-edge features like Flakes, CA derivations or new language frameworks in Nixpkgs, since they are prone to a large amount of flux and frequently render documentation obsolete, which is a significant reason why nobody has invested in the effort in documenting them. Part of the reason why is that I think we have the conception that documentation is supposed to be *definitive* and act more like specifications, when in reality a lot of us would appreciate docs of *some* shape or form, regardless of whether they are up-to-date with the current design or not. IMO a way to ameliorate this is for the SC, the Nix team, and the Nixpkgs Core team to encourage people to write **incomplete** docs *simultaneously* as they are contributing new features to the Nix ecosystem, since *some* docs is better than *no* docs at all.

The other kind of documentation issue is the legacy cruft that had been building for 20 years, which usually comes in the form of ✨ magic ✨ ­— `__overrides`, `__structuredAttrs`, `__darwinAllowLocalNetworking`, etc. — which are either failed designs or are deemed temporary fixes that should be rectified properly, but have remained this way for years. I believe we need to encourage contributors to the wider Nix ecosystem to document them even though they may be "hacks", to overcome our innate distaste of things that didn't quite turn out how we want them to.

Like what K900 said, we might also want to investigate into hiring a technical writer or choose one within the community to lay out the foundations of our documentation efforts — things like style, language, glossary, etc. that can be standardized for anyone willing to contribute large portions to official documentation. One of the things I found that immensely helped me as a writer on technical topics is [Apple's Style Guide](https://help.apple.com/pdf/applestyleguide/en_US/apple-style-guide.pdf), which shows you the exact steps (and reasoning) to ensure that all official Apple material shares a similar voice even though tens if not hundreds of people are responsible for all the documentation involved. I suppose we could create one for the Nix ecosystem as well, if anyone is up for the task.

### What is your view on licensing? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/338))


Right now, the ecosystem is very split between permissive licenses (MIT), copyleft-ish licenses (LGLP, MPL), and copyleft licenses (GPL). This signifies a wider disagreement between people on what community is, and what to expect.

Licenses are by no means perfect, but they signify intention and direction. They are like a COC: adopting one doesn't instantly solve all of your problems (nor is expected to), but it shows where the project is heading. This has a lot of consequences later down the line. It could be argued that Nixpkgs being MIT-licensed is a reason why there are so many companies hanging around it; it could likewise be argued that the reason DetSys hasn't been more successful with their "downstream distribution" has to do with LGPL.

What is your view on licensing? Are you planning to put out guidelines for licensing official and community projects? Pursue relicensing various projects? 

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/338#issuecomment-3349122682">link</a>)</summary>

I don't really quite understand what would be the issue with choosing different licenses — they're all suitable for different purposes. For a project like Nixpkgs that aims to be as all-encompassing and universal as possible, it makes sense for it to be licensed under a very permissive license like MIT so that there aren't many legal obstacles to contributing and using Nixpkgs. For another project like CppNix it makes complete sense to license it under LGPL, so that forks of Nix (e.g. Lix, DetNix) must remain open-source while proprietary software is still allowed to use its constituent parts as libraries to interact with Nix source code, the Nix store, etc.

While it's common for some other ecosystems to adopt a "default" license (for example Rust with MIT/Apache 2.0) it is by no means required, nor does the fact that we use a variety of licenses imply a disunity or inconsistency between official projects. Therefore, I would advocate for maintaining a status quo — if it ain't broke, don't fix it (especially when it means you don't have to request permission from between [hundreds](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/graphs/contributors) to [literal thousands of individual contributors](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/graphs/contributors) which are too much to count by GitHub standards).

<summary>How should the SC communicate with the community? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/199">link</a>)</summary>

The [list of official announcements](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/announcements/steering-committee/57) from the first year of SC starts with two general updates in November and December 24, then continues with only specific announcement on certain topics. Even if a bit delayed, the Foundation has given [more updates](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/meta/nixos-foundation/47).

Arguably there was not much insight for the community into what the SC was working on.

Everybody running feels strongly about serving the Nix community by running for election, but we also know that not all of us are going to get elected.

I'd like to ask if my colleagues would join me in publicly declaring their belief in an orderly and peaceful election and governance process. *Even if not elected, all of us can serve the community by setting a good example of behavior and decorum!*


### The Election Integrity Pledge:

>As a candidate for the Steering Committee, in order to demonstrate a good community spirit and trust, I hereby pledge that henceforth...
>
>* ...I believe that as a community we are here to do our best work and to ship code.
>* ...I support and celebrate the democratic nature of our elections.
> * ...if elected, I will dutifully and in good-faith participate in all SC work for as long as I have a seat.
> * ...elected or not, I will support the SC and the governance processes, and refrain from slandering or libeling SC members or candidates, or misrepresenting SC actions in public spaces.
> * ...I will not participate in, encourage, or aid public pressure campaigns against the SC, its members, or its candidates.
> * ...I will act with integrity and honor in the discharge of my duties.

<summary>How are you going to interact with Lix? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/283">link</a>)</summary>

Lix is now a major part of the ecosystem, providing a non-commercial, production-ready alternative to Nix. It falls outside of governance power of SC, but coordination with it is of paramount importance for Nix development, security patching, and stability of Nixpkgs (as there have been numerous occasions where Lix has fixed a crucial bug that was preventing Nixpkgs work, while Nix hasn't). Historically, there has been hostility towards Lix and running it on NixOS Community infra.

<summary>How are you going to resolve S3 cache situation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/336">link</a>)</summary>

S3 cache size continues to rise. AWS still pays the bills for it, but this part of infra is something that might need a look.

Latest updates on the topic that I could find were from about a year ago on the Discourse:

https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-06-06-re-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-6/46617
https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-07-10-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-7/48821

My understanding is that it's a complicated topic, where a lot of technical decisions need to be made, and Foundation needs to get a lot of talks with various potential partners, and this needs to be coordinated. Binary cache is a center piece of the infra, so its future needs to be well-secured; do you have any concrete steps in mind on how to proceed? Maybe coordinating with someone doing software archiving?

<summary>How are you planning to pursue a trademark? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/340">link</a>)</summary>

A trademark is direly needed, as there are many commercial projects who use "Nix" in their name for marketing purposes, sometimes confusingly. However, the trademark rules have to be reasonable for downstream users, and put clear guidelines. Furthermore, there might be conflicts if the trademark policy doesn't match a company's path. Additionally, it will require a clear set of guidelines between what each of Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS project constitutes, and how much "Nix" they share (possibly with renaming?)

How do you plan to handle this?

Nix is a central piece of the ecosystem, and Nix team holds authority over it. Additionally, many Nix team members are a long-time, trusted community members, making them overwhelmingly more likely to be elected. One of the purposes of SC is to coordinate different teams; this poses a clear conflict of interest, when someone is in both Nix team and SC, as that person's interests as an SC member and Nix team member are not necessarily aligned.

How is such a conflict of interest planned to be addressed, or resolved?

<summary>How are you going to reform SC? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/284">link</a>)</summary>

To me, SC results were disappointing. Despite the community having clearly cast their votes, not much of substance was achieved in a year. This is indicative of a "committee" situation: where consensus is required to make any decisions. This poses an existential threat to the effectiveness of SC, as SC is meant to represent very diverse parts of the community, that often have conflicting interests. Achieving consensus in such a case is a pipe dream.

That's why SC members need a lot more autonomy, to be able to make decisions on their own (overriden by majority, if significant opposition arises) and not get blocked by achieving impossible consensus. This is the entire purpose of SC, as consensus-driven decisions were made with RFCs, and ran into all the same issues.

Considering this, how would you reform the SC to allow for more individual action and autonomy?

(This is a little targeted, though everyone is welcome to chime in with their thoughts, of course.)

In https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3354754312 you said that you're worried about the current definition of "conflict of interest" not including "being involved in competing implementations and communities, social media groups, country, military status, and so forth".

What is a "competing implementation" or "competing community" to you? What level of involvement would you consider significant enough to constitute CoI? What decisions are you expecting the SC to make where this CoI becomes an issue?

Also, once again, as a litmus test, would any of these people be considered to have a CoI?
- a Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc team member
- a Determinate Systems employee
- a Snix/Tvix/Lix/etc contributor
- a contibutor to both NixOS/nix and Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc
- a person present in Tvix/Snix/Lix/etc discussion spaces
- an Auxolotl/Ekala/etc contributor
- a contributor to both NixOS/nixpkgs and Ekala/Auxolotl/etc
- a person present in Auxolotl/Ekala/etc discussion spaces

Also, can you maybe name examples of social media groups or countries that would be considered to have a CoI, and why/when?
