### Conflict of interest disclosure

I own a small LLC--no business for a few years now--that does consulting, and at one point was building a NixOS hosting service. Nothing came of that.

I believe that I have no conflict of interests.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

#### What I have done

I have helped add various improvements ( https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Acrertel ) to the homepage, notably adding the NixOS Values to the website, cleaning up the presentation of official vs. unofficial spaces, updating some links, and so forth.

I'm a maintainer of the lmstudio package (which I'm able to keep up to date with the help of some great folks) and have also adopted some packages that became orphaned for one reason or another (libthai, glee, xscope, bemenu, muso--if you need something there, feel free to ping me!).

I've started a process of adding some missing functionality to the nix-unit package (https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-unit-improvements/69296) in hopes that we can further improve the CI and testing story for NixOS.

I'm a co-organizer of the Nix Vegas community at this year's DEF CON, where we had a great time (https://nix.vegas/blog/2025-retrospective/) talking about NixOS and hosting excellent talks.

#### What I will do

My basic goal is to help make the Nix community and ecosystem boring and predictable, so that everybody--regardless of skill level, corporate or academic affiliation, hobbyist or professional or amateur leanings, or anything else--is able to get value from it and is able to give back however they're able.

There are tactical wins to be had in specific initiatives, for example documentation and on-boarding, and there are also strategic gains to be made in terms of how we work with commercial partners and how we manage our infrastructure. I hope that I can work with other like-minded people on the SC to achieve those goals and to leave the ecosystem better than when I joined it.

I think the SC can do a better job communicating what it's doing, and I hope to help figure out how we can achieve a more legible posture there.

I care a great deal about the quality of discourse and behavior of the community towards each other and people outside of it, and I hope to help continue to reinforce and normalize the Values so that we can all have a friendly place to do our best work.
