### Conflict of interest disclosure

I helped found Flox and worked there, now I work for Anduril.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

My goal is to promulgate Nix/NixOS by using the network effects of large-scale adoption.

### What I have done

I am part of the inaugural Steering Committee where we established how we would work together, served as an escalation point for decisions, [founded](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/formalize-creation-of-the-stdenv-team/54232) [multiple](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/establishing-the-nixpkgs-core-team/69743) [teams](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/creation-of-the-nixos-hardware-team/63974), executed a [formalized sponsorship program](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/nixcon.md#sponsorship-process), and [performed oversight functions](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828) for the community. I have established trust with much of the community, forged coalitions, and have a record of being able to work broadly across the ecosystem to address issues. I've also worked on increasing the Nix contributor base, mentored Nixpkgs contributors, and helped organize Nix-focused [conferences](https://planetnix.com/) [and](https://nix.vegas/) [events](https://dmvnix.org/).

### What I will do

I will continue to create and organize events, try to establish partnerships and sponsorships, and work toward creating a sustainable Nix ecosystem.
