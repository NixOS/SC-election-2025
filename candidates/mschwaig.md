### Conflict of interest disclosure

I work for Johannes Kepler University Linz, in Austria.

My contract there runs out at the end of the year, and I will most likely look for other ways to fund my work or earn a living then, for example through employment, research grants or consulting on supply chain security.
I hope I can continue my work on supply chain security fundamentals in Nix in that context.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

Last year we established a constitution and a set of [values](https://nixos.org/values/) to organize around.
Many of us are understandably scared about the future, some of us feel deeply threatened, making it extra difficult to figure out how to best apply our values for the overall benefit of everyone. This is not possible without weighing various perspectives on emotionally charged issues in some way.

Some things others have done and said may have made us angry. Nonetheless, I think our values are not meant as a tool for seeing others as morally inferior, and self-righteously kicking down.
Instead, even as we worry about the future, we have to try our best to hold on to [respect and civility](https://nixos.org/values/), while preventing harm and protecting rights.

Uncomfortable feelings will always come up to some degree no matter what our policies are.
While these feelings are understandable, they are not an excuse for doing anything less than trying our best to see each other as [people](https://nixos.org/values/#community-values-people). We should especially not jump to conclusions about the contents of people's minds and hearts, and treat one another harshly based on those conclusions.

I strongly believe that this difficult, imperfect collective lesson will be easier to learn for us as a community, than the tempting alternative project of collectively engineering a formally-verified-to-be-morally-right downward-kick distribution algorithm on Discourse to replace our established common values.

**We built formal mechanisms to distribute power and accountability, including safeguards, in part as an alternative to outrage-driven governance, because outrage-driven governance inflames and uses our feelings. In the process, it tends to burn out everyone involved, while making us lose perspective on how much common ground most of us could discover in a respectful, nuanced 1:1 discussion.**

#### What I have done

I'm pursuing a PhD in supply chain security in Nix, so I've spent a lot of time on understanding its security properties.

As part of this work I am proposing a new signature format for Nix:

I also work on fully automated packaging with Nix using LLMs:

#### What I will do

- I will suggest delegation as a governance mechanism whenever possible, so that the SC can focus on embodying the opinions of wider community. This encourages the SC to actually make decisions out of respect for the time and effort of those that do delegated work and have delegated responsibilities.
- I will do what is necessary for the Foundation to take in money for technical work, with sufficient care and safeguards, so that we can systematically start taking more active ownership of and start addressing our existing technical problems.
- On moderation I do see a need to carefully balance having a coherent team of people that trust each other with making sure nobody in the community feels entitled to kick down without consequences based on their own personal convictions. Ideally those are totally unrelated, but in reality any team, like any person, will have some biases that could create blind spots. While I will approach former and current moderators about these topics with humility and open ears, I will also be firm on the need for the moderation team to be not only autonomous, but also accountable to the SC, regardless of whether or not there actually is bias right now.
