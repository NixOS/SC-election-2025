## Conflict of interest disclosure

I'm a french public servant, working at CNRS. Software maintenance has been my main role there since 2017, and I don't expect this to change anytime soon.

## Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I really just want to work on packaging stuff, and to provide reliable systems to my family, friends, and colleagues. And the world. I am thrilled to be in a community with many highly skilled peers for this task. But I observe social issues hurting them and diverting them from their full potential, so my conscience tell me that I should be working on that first.

### What I have done

- Work in nixpkgs, mostly on scientific software. I'm especially familiar with the Python & CMake ecosystems.

- Served in the moderation team for a bit more than a year.

### What I will do

My priority is to protect the community. For this I'll follow Elinor Ostrom and claim that we need clear boundaries on who is or not part of that community. I've seen too many total strangers only coming to heat up political debates, or "just asking questions" and wreak havoc.

> Individuals gain trust and status by doing the work.

I'll also push on improving internal communication and transparency between SC and teams. It must be clear that SC itself is:

> subject to high[est] expectation for their conduct.

And finally, I'll work on the creation of a tooling team. Those tool we have to help us work on packaging are awesome. Let's celebrate, grow, and cherish them !


## Q&A

### Should the SC vote for confidence instead of for no-confidence? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/472))


The [constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#full-reelections) reads:

> A simple majority within the SC may call a reelection of the entire SC based on perceived loss of confidence.

This can lead to a 3-3 deadlock as we [currently](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) [see](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/6). In this deadlock, neither the reelection, nor any majority vote can pass - the SC is unable to function.

**In many legislatures, this is flipped into a vote of confidence that must pass to avoid a re-election.** This would have the same results for a full SC, but avoid situations like the current 3-3 deadlock.

Do you support amending the constitution accordingly?

### How would you handle an SC member joining Anduril? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/190))


Recently, current SC member Tom Bereknyei took a new job at Anduril. After parts of the community [criticized](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971) the SC for not communicating this publicly, the SC gave a [statement](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/statement-on-a-steering-committee-member-joining-anduril/69007).

As an SC member, how would you like the SC to handle such a situation in the future?

*Please focus on the community aspects and be specific in what actions should be taken in such a scenario. This is not the place to discuss your opinion about the [MIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex).*

> People with higher visibility within the project or towards the public are subject to higher expectations for their conduct. 

So SC members are subject to the highest. Also, elected members are public people, so they loose a bit of privacy while in office.

Therefore, I think a change in affiliation must be properly disclosed as soon as possible.

And if that affiliation change imply a company with a clear lack of trust from an important part of the community, I will publicly ask that member to consider resignation. For the good of the trust of the community in the SC, but also for the good of this individual, who will certainly suffer from the situation. 

A new vote of one seat can be organized, and that person can even be candidate under their new affiliation if they want.

### If mods are cops, who should decide on punishments? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464))


Related to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/428 and the ongoing discussion on discourse about the resignation of the moderation team: https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828

I’ve seen different metaphors for what moderators are supposed to be. Some say moderators are like cops (enforcing rules), others say they’re like paramedics (helping people in crisis).

But no one has made the case for moderators as _judges_. If moderators are indeed tasked with enforcing rules, who then plays the role of the judiciary in our governance model? Do you think mods alone should be able to decide on the punishment (especially lifetime bans)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/464#issuecomment-3383516905">link</a>)</summary>

In some situations, moderation action must be quick and strong, and nobody else is available. Therefore each moderator need both the power to decide and the power to act.

I don't like the metaphors, for sure, but as a simplification, yes, mods can be cops and judges, in some very specific situations.

Obviously, after the event, there is a need for accountability and counterbalances, like "[other trusted community members may privately ask the moderators about a specific suspension](https://github.com/NixOS/moderation/#practices)", or SC.

And from my ~1y experience in mod team and my point of view this is enough: we had very few cases of "trusted community members" / SC members who did ask about a specific use of those powers, and nobody had to blow the whistle. And the SC can override a ban, but never had to.

No, the real issue we had was not using enough these powers, at least in the eyes of some members of the community who dislike others members of the community. (Sometimes you get person A demanding you to ban person B and vice-versa…)

But having some power comes with the responsibility to know when not to use it. Thus, most of our work was private discussions with the involved parties inside the community, to enable them to communicate what they needed to say in the best way for everyone, and to help them understand the point of view of the others.

And that's why I think mods are mostly paramedics.


edit: If this is not convincing enough: 

The 2 last persons for whom I personally had to use those powers, publicly, did endorse my candidature in this election, also publicly. I now enjoy chatting with them. And they are clearly not aligned politically. 

I'm very proud of that, and I think it is a good illustration to show that the previous SC should not having been pushing that hard to "fix" the mod team. It was functional. 

Yes, the fact that we did work mostly with private message does not allow the community do judge what we were doing in real time, but the obvious solution to that was just to talk with us: for the private messages to work, a trust that it will stay private must be established.

And the many people with whom I discussed about that in the 2 previous NixCon did understand and explicitly support this work.

### Should community-related Conflicts of Interest be considered for the SC election? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192))


The [constitution explicitly mentions](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/constitution.md#conflict-of-interest-coi-balance) "employees of the same company or otherwise the same payer for Nix work" as *examples* of Conflicts of Interest for the constitution of the SC.

In the current SC, we had three members of the Nix team (Ericson2314, roberth, tomberek) and two members of the commit bit delegation team (jtojnar, winterqt), which arguably reduces diversity as well.

Should team-memberships in the community also be considered as Conflicts of Interest for the SC election? Why (not)?

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3382668438">link</a>)</summary>

### In general

1 person both in a team and SC is great for the communication and understanding between that team and SC. They may have to recuse themself from a few things, but the advantages are totally worth it.

2 persons are okay I guess, but I'd prefer to see at least one of those not too much involved in the team. I mean if the team is in a rush for some reason, and we get 2 SC members not 100% available because of that reason, it is a real issue. (and if those prefer working on SC and let the team down, that is not better).

But 3, I really think this is a mistake. I'm not going to craft new election rules for that, but I'd strongly encourage the people in that situation to reconsider.


### About this particular Nix Team case

I'm very sad that roberth decided to leave the nix team. We don't have plenty of people available and able to work that well in Nix team, but we have plenty candidates for SC.

Initially, I joined the moderation team because I had the impression that hexa, k900, and lassulus were overwhelmed by moderation tasks. I hugely value their work on key technical parts of the ecosystem, and I knew I could not best them there. I also knew it would be hard for me to work with them on those technical parts while knowing about the mountain of other unpleasant chores in the moderation.

Therefore I decided to try to help them in moderation with the hope of giving them more air and time to focus on the enjoyable parts of the work and the community. (btw, that is a success for hexa, but a total failure for lassulus. Sorry.)

I feel the same for our 3 Nix team members: they really should not have to do both tasks. We should find other members in the community to share the load.

I did vote for them last year because I was pretty new in the community, and I knew their name through their work.

But in retrospect, electing the 3 was a clear mistake. We should try to avoid that happening again. And not by demanding them to leave a technical team, especially when they are key parts of a key team.

### What would be some concrete steps you would take in the first few months? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/195))


Please mention some concrete steps you would take in the first few months after being elected to the SC.

<details>
<summary>Answer (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/195#issuecomment-3383296513">link</a>)</summary>

I'd like to start by working on the definition of the community.

Firstly because I love it and want to protect it. And for this we kind of need to know who is in and who is not. I know first-hand that this will help the next moderation team: protecting the community from an outsider can't be handled in the same way as mediation between members.

Secondly because I believe in open source as a Common Good. So for this project to thrive, [defining its boundaries is a pre-requisite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#%22Design_principles_illustrated_by_long-enduring_CPR_(Common_Pool_Resource)_institutions%22).


### Organisations

I think we should define more clearly the presence of organisations in the community. 

#### Separation of concerns

For example, I would provide them a separate discourse account to speak to the community. Currently we have their individual members speaking for them, and this has a ton of issues, like:

- it is not directly explicit for a newcommer when a member is speaking for their org
- members who speak for their org can get assimilated to that org in the eyes of the public, so they personnaly have a harder time interacting about other stuff (eg. if you just announced an official new thing at your company, you may not be able to freely share news about your pet in the same space)
- members who spoke for an org leave a weird history when they quit that org
- the people tend to love (or loathe) the speaking member, while the feelings might be better targeted at the org
- if moderation is required with an org, it should not target personnaly its members

#### Recognition

I'd also love if we could proudly display all the orgs we have, and what they have done for the community. Our values state "Organisations gain prestige by funding the work of individuals and providing resources to support the project", so I think we should have a place to make this concrete.

It would show-off that nix is worth investing into, at least in the eyes of our many orgs and sponsors, and therefore help the general public grasp the size and importance of the project. It would also help gathering future sponsoring.

#### Conduct

Individuals are subject to our Code of Conduct, but this is not appropriate for orgs. Currently we can only try to apply the CoC to some specific members, but that is very wrong. So we need to find a way to define the limits of what orgs should do within the community, and to properly define the sanctions that might be imposed on them when they don't respect that.

We should be able to cleanly sanction an org with a minimal impact on its individual members, like we are able to clealy sanction an individual with a minimal impact on their org.

Our values also state that "People with higher visibility within the project or towards the public are subject to higher expectations for their conduct". Orgs obviously have a very high visiblity, compared to individuals, but they are excluded from this sentence: I think this is a mistake.


### Individuals

To define membership we have:

- membership in Board / SC / Teams
- github:
    - membership in orgs / teams
    - maintainer / committer status
    - merged commits authored
    - opened PRs
    - interactions history
- discourse:
    - account
    - badges
    - trust level
    - interactions history
- matrix:
    - joined rooms
    - interactions history

This is currently already used in different places, like elections, or discourse available actions.

I would like to use that more. First, to encourage participation, as in gamification (with safeguards). But also to put limits: an individual with no prior interaction within the community should not be able to start a political fight. An individual with only a couple commits should not be able to monopolize discussions. Once again, our values state: "Individuals gain trust and status by doing the work", so we should also make this more concrete: between newcommer and well-known, the more trust and status one gains by doing the work, the more things they should be allowed to do.

Since many members of the community are tired of political fights and drama in general, a simple measure could be to have those discussions in a private space, guarded by some membership requirements. This could allow people who don't want to talk about politics to just stay outside of that private space, even if they would be allowed inside. (obviously, until they'll decide to join, they will have no voice in political matters: one can't assert their political views while rejecting political discussions). And maybe we would appear less dramatic in outside media and social networks.

### Who are "The Nix Community", and why? ([link](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/436))


One outcome of the NCA was the "Constitution", which advertises "Values". It falls short, however, of "constituting a community": it does not attempt to describe anything resembling a "membership predicate", a matter that was intensively discussed in the Governance Zulip. I'm interested in the candidates' reasoning and reflection about the community's composition, but here's also a few litmus tests:

- Are DetSys and Anduril "part of the community"?
- Is Jon Ringer "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Is srid "part of the community"? Has he ever been?
- Generally, how does moderation action affect "community membership"?
- Are former maintainers, who resigned in support of either of the two Open Letters, "part of the community"?
  - If they have not contributed back to the project since?
  - If they participate in discussions on Discourse or in Social Media?
  - If they contribute only to forks?
  - If they contribute to forks, but backport ad hoc?
- Are Lix, Snix, the Foundation, or the nix-community "part of the community"?
- Are NixCon Sponsors "part of the community"?
- Of participants of Nix-Offtopic and Discourse, are those, who do not "contribute" code, documentation, or decision-making, still "part of the community"?

Finally,

- Are people who disagree with the composition or the priorities of the "Values" part of the community?

I think we need to define multiple levels of "The Community". I would answer different level of "yes" to all those tests.

But we have yet to define what are those levels, and what are their associated rights and duties. That would be one of the first focus for me.

<summary>How transparent should the SC be? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/407">link</a>)</summary>

In a [blog post](https://www.haskellforall.com/2025/09/steering-committee-retrospective.html), resigned SC member @Gabriella439 recommended future SCs to increase transparency toward the community. (A different recommendation there, regarding SC size, is the subject of #265.)

In particular, the argument for this went (non-header emphasis mine):

> **Poor self-organization and internal policies/procedures**

[...]

> I think one of the big mistakes we made was that we insisted on **“speaking with one voice”**, meaning that we could not make any meaningful external statements or comments without getting majority approval from the committee (something we had difficulty with on the regular). This is why the committee remained largely silent or slow-to-respond on a large number of issues.

> This problem got bad enough that at some point many members began to break the wall of silence by commenting in an unofficial capacity on high-profile issues so that outsiders would get some visibility into what was going on instead of waiting for us to completely the slow process of gathering enough consensus and votes.

> Another internal policy that I believe was counter-productive was **not disclosing the final votes** on various issues or requiring individual signatories on public statements. Had we done this it would have likely broken a lot of internal stalemates and filibusters if all committee members were held publicly accountable for their policy positions (and therefore subject to public pressure).

> It would have also helped with another issue, which was:

> **Absenteeism**

> For various reasons (some justifiable, some not), at many points in time a large number of committee members would be unreachable, even during crucial junctures like ongoing controversy. This absenteeism was masked by the committee not publicizing that fact earlier. **If we had required all votes to be publicly recorded and all statements to require individual signatories** it would have exposed this absenteeism earlier (and led to quicker corrections).

As such, I would like to ask SC candidates: how do you regard the topic of SC transparency in light of @Gabriella439's recommendations, if not more generally? Further, how would you concretely enact these views in the SC, if elected?

<summary>Stance on specific case of statements made by external actors (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/485">link</a>)</summary>

The following was authored by @jaen but I'm posting it on their behalf because they cannot and I would like answers to it as well. The title of the issue was written by me.

---

The recent SC turmoil had been commented on outside the community in various venues. In particular, I'd like to draw attention to this [Twitter thread](https://xcancel.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1972037286192992320) where certain individuals talk about _“get[ting] these nut jobs out”_ and that _“[M]aybe @<!-- -->PalmerLuckey can help turn the ship around.”_ While the Anduril founder does not acknowledge those proposals directly, he says this:

> The good news is that Anduril will keep using Nix to build ever more powerful weapons for American dominance regardless of what the fringe "community" people say.

The question is, what is your stance on this thread — is it a nothingburger, or an indication of existential threat to community governance and self-sovereignity — and what steps, if any, do you plan to take to insulate the project against the threat, should it it materialise into something more concrete than online bickering.

And as a corollary to that, what does Nix governance and self-sovereignity means for you, do you feel it’s an important aspect for the SC to work towards and what would your be general policy to handle potential threats stemming from external actors looking to control the project to their own ends. Consider what limits — if any — you would seek to put on such a threat actor, how — if at all — could that extend to functions community members associated with them could perform at a maintainer and/or governance levels, for example to ensure the threat actor cannot pressure them into acting against the project's best interests.

<summary>What should happen in the event of an SC member resigning early? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/481">link</a>)</summary>

The SC is currently elected by proportional representation, which seeks to reflect the preferences of its voters.
However, over this initial SC term we have seen multiple early resignations, potentially making what remains of the SC less representative of its voter base, if not also affecting [decision-making capabilities](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/some-procedural-clarifications-on-the-constitution/70278).

Now, there may be alternate ways to deal with scenarios involving early retirement, including going over the original votes to recalculate what alternate candidate might best represent this part of the electorate, or (eventually) even calling new elections.

<summary>politics of tech and governing values (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/487">link</a>)</summary>

Whereas the existing Nix projects have licenses already, one popular adage states technology is not neutral - perhaps increasingly obviously so, as the impact of technology continues to grow.

As such, zooming out a bit, one of the topics the community has seen different takes on seems whether we should govern by certain values, as exemplified by actions such as the earlier open letter against MIC sponsorships, a sentiment that seemed represented among contributors, or 'keep politics out', a sentiment that has seemed represented more at e.g. the NixOS sub-reddit.

Over the past days, there have been [multiple](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/sc-member-tomberek-works-for-anduril/68971/) [calls](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/) for individual SC candidates to step down, or even calling for a [full reelection](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/call-for-full-re-election-of-the-steering-committee/70208/).

Current procedures have yet to take into account such desires, meaning we would currently depend on either:

Since then, there were some efforts on the SC side to draft a comprehensive sponsorship policy, and they also started approving/denying sponsors directly, without delegation to NixCon team.

Do you feel like SC taking on this job is adequate in the long run, or do you see it as a temporary measure? What are your next steps on pursuing a sponsorship policy?

<summary>How are you going to interact with Lix? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/283">link</a>)</summary>

Lix is now a major part of the ecosystem, providing a non-commercial, production-ready alternative to Nix. It falls outside of governance power of SC, but coordination with it is of paramount importance for Nix development, security patching, and stability of Nixpkgs (as there have been numerous occasions where Lix has fixed a crucial bug that was preventing Nixpkgs work, while Nix hasn't). Historically, there has been hostility towards Lix and running it on NixOS Community infra.

How do you plan to structure your communication with Lix Project?

<summary>How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/197">link</a>)</summary>

There is an [ongoing](https://discourse.nixos.org/search?q=Determinate%20Nix%20%23links%20in%3Atitle%20order%3Alatest) conflict between Determinate Systems and parts of the community. Some aspects of this, such as the "Nix the trademark" are likely things for the [foundation](https://github.com/nixos/foundation) to deal with.

However, Determinate Systems is *part of the community* as well, so this conflict also has aspects internal to the Nix community.

How should the SC handle the DetSys conflict in the community?

<summary>How should the SC deal with people in the org chart not respecting their authority? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/491">link</a>)</summary>

This question is based on a question from the previous year: https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114
> **Title: What's the best way for the steering committee to deal with inaction or being ignored?**
> One of the main ways in which the previous Nix governance has been criticized is for ignoring or being inactive in the face of community protests and concerns.[1](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#user-content-fn-1-be51383cd9081764e2d5d66461ad8100)
> 
> Let's suppose that the steering committee is now responsive to the community... but when the steering committee asks for or directs action, that request is ignored, de-prioritized, or litigated by the relevant parties.
> 
> How would you as a single SC member deal with this? How would you ask for your fellow steering committee members to act as a group?
>
> [1]: I'm not interested in rehashing or re-litigating these specific cases or people involved; please do not do so in your answer. [↩](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114#user-content-fnref-1-be51383cd9081764e2d5d66461ad8100)

I would like to specifically add that the party in question might escalate the matter into the court of public opinion.

In the answers from the previous year there was a very clear dividing line among candidates about not only using explicit powers granted by the constitution, versus using activism.

Would you advocate for the SC using activism proactively?
Would you advocate for the SC using activism once a matter is moved into the court of public opinion?
How do you think the SC should react to activism?
At what point should the SC concede to activist pressures?

Adding to that footnote, I also don't mean to say this is hat happened recently or want to litigate specific recent events, I'm interested in other candidates general view on these kinds of issues.

<summary>What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to community and Foundation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/337">link</a>)</summary>

What kind of relationship should unofficial spaces (Reddit, Discord) have to the community? Should they be linked on the homepage? If so, should they be compelled to comply with the Foundation's code of conduct? Should we attempt to convert these communities into official spaces (if so, at what point)?

<summary>How are you going to resolve S3 cache situation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/336">link</a>)</summary>

S3 cache size continues to rise. AWS still pays the bills for it, but this part of infra is something that might need a look.

Latest updates on the topic that I could find were from about a year ago on the Discourse:

https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-06-06-re-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-6/46617
https://discourse.nixos.org/t/2024-07-10-long-term-s3-cache-solutions-meeting-minutes-7/48821

My understanding is that it's a complicated topic, where a lot of technical decisions need to be made, and Foundation needs to get a lot of talks with various potential partners, and this needs to be coordinated. Binary cache is a center piece of the infra, so its future needs to be well-secured; do you have any concrete steps in mind on how to proceed? Maybe coordinating with someone doing software archiving?

<summary>Should electoral alliances/coalitions count as conflicts of interest? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/479">link</a>)</summary>

Related to #470.

It has been brought to my attention that several candidates are interested in forming electoral coalitions[^1] where candidates agree to vote for each other in time for the election. This could significantly change the result of the election, especially if coalitions decide to formalize which candidates they choose to vote for and which they do not, and if many members of the same coalition are elected to office, their shared interests could dominate the SC. In spite of this, there are currently no rules in place that will require electoral coalition/alliance status to be disclosed in each candidate's statement. 

Do you think participation in coalitions and alliances *has to be* disclosed? If not, do you think they *should* be disclosed?

[^1]: To be clear, *informal* alignments such as friendships do not count here — whether *those* should be counted as CoIs deserve a different issue altogether.

<summary>How are you planning to pursue a trademark? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/340">link</a>)</summary>

A trademark is direly needed, as there are many commercial projects who use "Nix" in their name for marketing purposes, sometimes confusingly. However, the trademark rules have to be reasonable for downstream users, and put clear guidelines. Furthermore, there might be conflicts if the trademark policy doesn't match a company's path. Additionally, it will require a clear set of guidelines between what each of Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS project constitutes, and how much "Nix" they share (possibly with renaming?)

How do you plan to handle this?

<summary>If you were in a previous SC, how would you vote on public issues? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/281">link</a>)</summary>

There were several decisions made by previous SC in response to community conflicts. They set an important benchmark to gauge candidate's decision-making. Those questions are:

    Allow Anduril to keep publishing jobs on Discourse?
    Replace PolyMC with Prism Launcher?
    What should be the policy on MIC participation?
    What should be the policy for telemetry?

What additional initiatives would you raise?

<summary>How do you want to structure communication with Determinate Systems? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/341">link</a>)</summary>

The title might seem excessively direct. However, last year, there was a question on MIC policy and Anduril ban. Since then, SC has enforced a ban on Anduril job posting. Anduril has been a very controversial company for the wide community; I feel like it's fitting to ask about another controversial company, and how to interact with it.

What are the problems you see with communication between Determinate Systems and NixOS Community? Are there concrete suggestions you have, or would like to propose? What other areas of work (Nix improvements, trademark policy, etc.) do you feel prevent healthy collaboration?

<summary>What are your thoughts on documentation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/339">link</a>)</summary>

Documentation is often cited as being lackluster, incomplete, or confusing. Personally, I disagree; I've seen many improvements to documentation over the years, and I think it has come a long way. Still, those improvements don't address the core issue for why documentation *feels* lackluster.

IMO, the issue is because the boundaries between projects are not clear. A new NixOS user will look at the NixOS manual for help: but really, they are using Nix+Nixpkgs+NixOS stack. For a beginner, it is not clear why there would be three manuals, and where the boundaries lie, and which manual they need (especially when interacting with a layering violation). This provides a frustrating experience, where despite the information being abundant, it is not at all discoverable in a relevant fashion.

Is this something that you are concerned with? What do you want to do with it? Direct more resources into cross-cutting documentation projects, like nix.dev or wiki.nixos.org ? Work on clearer project boundaries? Attempt to bridge documentation?

I am curious to hear your thoughts.

<summary>How are you planning to reconcile conflicts between SC and Nix team? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/285">link</a>)</summary>

Nix is a central piece of the ecosystem, and Nix team holds authority over it. Additionally, many Nix team members are a long-time, trusted community members, making them overwhelmingly more likely to be elected. One of the purposes of SC is to coordinate different teams; this poses a clear conflict of interest, when someone is in both Nix team and SC, as that person's interests as an SC member and Nix team member are not necessarily aligned.

How is such a conflict of interest planned to be addressed, or resolved?

<summary>What is your view on licensing? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/338">link</a>)</summary>

Right now, the ecosystem is very split between permissive licenses (MIT), copyleft-ish licenses (LGLP, MPL), and copyleft licenses (GPL). This signifies a wider disagreement between people on what community is, and what to expect.

Licenses are by no means perfect, but they signify intention and direction. They are like a COC: adopting one doesn't instantly solve all of your problems (nor is expected to), but it shows where the project is heading. This has a lot of consequences later down the line. It could be argued that Nixpkgs being MIT-licensed is a reason why there are so many companies hanging around it; it could likewise be argued that the reason DetSys hasn't been more successful with their "downstream distribution" has to do with LGPL.

What is your view on licensing? Are you planning to put out guidelines for licensing official and community projects? Pursue relicensing various projects?

<summary>How are you going to reform SC? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/284">link</a>)</summary>

To me, SC results were disappointing. Despite the community having clearly cast their votes, not much of substance was achieved in a year. This is indicative of a "committee" situation: where consensus is required to make any decisions. This poses an existential threat to the effectiveness of SC, as SC is meant to represent very diverse parts of the community, that often have conflicting interests. Achieving consensus in such a case is a pipe dream.

That's why SC members need a lot more autonomy, to be able to make decisions on their own (overriden by majority, if significant opposition arises) and not get blocked by achieving impossible consensus. This is the entire purpose of SC, as consensus-driven decisions were made with RFCs, and ran into all the same issues.

Considering this, how would you reform the SC to allow for more individual action and autonomy?

<summary>What is a "competing implementation", and should being involved in one constitute a conflict of interest? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/456">link</a>)</summary>

(This is a little targeted, though everyone is welcome to chime in with their thoughts, of course.)

In https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/192#issuecomment-3354754312 you said that you're worried about the current definition of "conflict of interest" not including "being involved in competing implementations and communities, social media groups, country, military status, and so forth".

What is a "competing implementation" or "competing community" to you? What level of involvement would you consider significant enough to constitute CoI? What decisions are you expecting the SC to make where this CoI becomes an issue?

Also, once again, as a litmus test, would any of these people be considered to have a CoI?
- a Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc team member
- a Determinate Systems employee
- a Snix/Tvix/Lix/etc contributor
- a contibutor to both NixOS/nix and Lix/Snix/Tvix/etc
- a person present in Tvix/Snix/Lix/etc discussion spaces
- an Auxolotl/Ekala/etc contributor
- a contributor to both NixOS/nixpkgs and Ekala/Auxolotl/etc
- a person present in Auxolotl/Ekala/etc discussion spaces

Also, can you maybe name examples of social media groups or countries that would be considered to have a CoI, and why/when?

<summary>Currently sitting SC members running for reelection: why did you vote the way you did on a vote of no confidence on 2025-09-30? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/452">link</a>)</summary>

Today, [a reply by @jtojnar](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-sc-prepared-to-lie-to-us-and-what-we-can-do-about-it-whistleblow/70103/38) on the whistleblowing post mentioned that the Steering Committee held a vote of no confidence today, 30 September 2025.

A "yes" vote to a vote of no confidence implies that the individual does not have trust in the SC. A "no" vote implies that there is still some trust left.

In a similar vein to https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2025/issues/256, opinions on past incidents present an important benchmark to judge candidate's moral and practical compass. This is even more important for existing SC members. SC has some out as a single front to make coordinated statements; I believe that to be an important mistake, that allows SC members to hide behind a bureaucratic body and avoid any kind of accountability. I believe it to be highly unfair. For that reason, I would like to know the historical votes of SC members on various issues.
