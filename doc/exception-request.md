# How to request a voter exception

People who have contributed roughly the equivalent of 25 commits within the [specified time period](../README.md#timeline),
but whose contributions aren't accurately counted automatically, have the option of requesting an exception.

Other than GitHub contributions, the EC will also consider contributions such as:
- Participation in official teams
- Infrastructure maintenance
- Organisation of official events
- Maintenance of official third-party accounts (e.g. social media)
- Significant contribution to important PRs under overall PR authorship of other users
- etc.

Be aware of the [the timeline](../README.md#timeline).

To request an exception:

1. Send an email to <elections@nixos.org> containing:
   - Links to your contributions within the [specified time period](../README.md#timeline).
   - Include your GitHub handle if you'd also like to interact with this repository
     to [endorse nominees](./endorse.md) or ask questions
2. You may [activate your email](./vote.md#email-activation) in advance in case you get accepted.
3. We might request more info from you, but eventually you will receive a reply stating whether you've been accepted.
4. If you've been accepted, check that your email and optionally GitHub id has been added to [the voter list](../eligible.csv).
